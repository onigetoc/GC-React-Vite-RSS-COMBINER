        <title>You can now get a yellow charging brick for $5 to match your Playdate’s cable</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>As spotted by a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/1h7z76e/new_accessory_us_standard_ac_adapter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-original-link="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/1h7z76e/new_accessory_us_standard_ac_adapter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> user this weekend, Panic is now selling a macaroni yellow <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://play.date/shop/ac-adapter/">charging brick</a> to go with the yellow cable that comes with the distinctively yellow Playdate. Say yellow again. The good news for anyone who wants a complete set of matching accessories is that it’s only $5 — the bad news is that shipping costs almost double that at its cheapest, so it’s kind of hard to justify buying on its own.</p>

<p>Also note that the 10W power adapter has a USB-A connection so it’ll work with your existing Playdate charging cable, but it’s otherwise kind of behind the times considering the general shift toward the USB-C connection. At the moment, Panic is only selling a version that’s compatible with the 2-prong plug type that’s standard in North America and Japan. It goes without saying that absolutely no one <em>needs</em> this — our Playdates have been charging just fine without it so far — but if you’re already on the site <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/i-like-this-ridiculous-playdate-pizza-case-so-much-i-bought-a-playdate-213610781.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/i-like-this-ridiculous-playdate-pizza-case-so-much-i-bought-a-playdate-213610781.html">getting a pizza case</a> now that they’re back in stock, then sure, go wild.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/you-can-now-get-a-yellow-charging-brick-for-5-to-match-your-playdates-cable-220316721.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Apple sued for failing to implement tools that would detect CSAM in iCloud</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple is being sued by victims of child sexual abuse over its failure to follow through with plans to scan iCloud for child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/technology/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-lawsuit.html" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/technology/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-lawsuit.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a> reports. In 2021, Apple announced it was working on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html"><ins>a tool to detect CSAM</ins></a> that would flag images showing such abuse and notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. But the company was hit with immediate backlash over the privacy implications of the technology, and ultimately <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-advanced-data-protection-imessage-contact-key-183819737.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/apple-advanced-data-protection-imessage-contact-key-183819737.html"><ins>abandoned the plan</ins></a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which was filed on Saturday in Northern California, is seeking damages upwards of $1.2 billion dollars for a potential group of 2,680 victims, according to <em>NYT</em>. It claims that, after Apple showed off its planned child safety tools, the company “failed to implement those designs or take any measures to detect and limit” CSAM on its devices, leading to the victims’ harm as the images continued to circulate. Engadget has reached out to Apple for comment.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement to <em>The New York Times</em> about the lawsuit, Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz said, “Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to fighting the ways predators put children at risk. We are urgently and actively innovating to combat these crimes without compromising the security and privacy of all our users.” The lawsuit comes just a few months after Apple was <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-accused-of-underreporting-suspected-csam-on-its-platforms-153637726.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/apple-accused-of-underreporting-suspected-csam-on-its-platforms-153637726.html"><ins>accused of underreporting CSAM</ins></a> by the UK’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-sued-for-failing-to-implement-tools-that-would-detect-csam-in-icloud-202940984.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>X adds, then quickly removes, Grok’s new ‘Aurora’ image generator</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, a new image generator called Aurora became available for some Grok users, many of whom <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/AILeaksAndNews/status/1865363337921384623"><ins>shared the tool’s results</ins></a> on X touting their photorealism. But as of Sunday afternoon, Aurora appears to be gone. While it briefly showed up as an option in Grok’s model selection menu as “Grok 2 + Aurora (beta),” it’s since been replaced with “Grok 2 + Flux (beta).” It looks like Aurora may have gone public before it was meant to. In a tweet replying to one user who shared images of Tesla’s Cybertruck created with Aurora, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1865497141818401202"><ins>Elon Musk</ins></a> said, “This is our internal image generation system. Still in beta, but it will improve fast.”</p>

        <title>Apple Vision Pro could soon work with PlayStation VR2 controllers</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple and Sony have quietly been working on bringing PlayStation VR2 controller support to the Apple Vision Pro, Mark Gurman reports in the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro?sref=10lNAhZ9" data-original-link="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Power On</em></a> newsletter. Gaming isn’t exactly the Vision Pro’s strong suit, thanks in part to the fact that it doesn’t support typical VR controllers. But Apple has reportedly approached Sony in hopes to remedy that. According to Gurman, the two partnered up earlier this year, and Sony has been working on the project for months.</p>
<p>Apple and Sony planned to have support for PS VR2’s Sense controllers ready by now, but the launch has been delayed as they iron out a few issues, Gurman notes — like the fact that Sony doesn’t produce and sell the controllers separately from its headset at the moment. Barring a scenario in which the project is “abruptly scrapped,” though, Gurman reports that we should still expect to see it happen. The ability to use Sony’s controllers with the Vision Pro headset would bring benefits beyond its gaming potential too, allowing for more precise input for tasks like media editing than is currently possible with its eye and gesture-based controls.</p>

        <title>Google sues after Consumer Financial Protection Bureau orders supervision of its payment arm</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-federal-supervision-of-google-following-contested-designation/" data-original-link="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-federal-supervision-of-google-following-contested-designation/"><ins>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</ins></a> (CFPB) on Friday said it has ordered federal supervision of Google Payment Corp. after determining that it meets the legal requirements for such oversight. The CFPB monitors banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, and recently finalized a rule to supervise digital payment apps. In the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_Publication-Redacted-Decision-and-Order-Designating-Google-Payment-for-Su_6EZQyMz.pdf" data-original-link="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_Publication-Redacted-Decision-and-Order-Designating-Google-Payment-for-Su_6EZQyMz.pdf"><ins>order</ins></a>, which focuses on the Google Pay app and its peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service (<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pay-is-shutting-down-in-the-us-later-this-year-105720968.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/google-pay-is-shutting-down-in-the-us-later-this-year-105720968.html">discontinued in the US earlier this year</a>), the CFPB said it has “reasonable cause to determine that Google has engaged in conduct that poses risks to consumers.” Google filed a lawsuit shortly after the announcement to challenge the decision, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-regulator-places-google-payment-corp-under-supervision-2024-12-06/" data-original-link="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-regulator-places-google-payment-corp-under-supervision-2024-12-06/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> reports.</p>
<p>The risks identified by the CFPB are tied to Google’s handling of erroneous transactions and fraud prevention. Based on customer complaints, the order said it appears that Google didn’t adequately investigate erroneous transfers, or adequately explain the findings of its investigations into these issues. The complaints also indicate Google didn’t do enough to prevent fraud, the order says. But, the CFPB announcement notes that the order “does not constitute a finding that the entity has engaged in wrongdoing,” nor does it “require the CFPB to conduct a supervisory examination.”</p>

        <title>X helped senators update the Kids Online Safety Act so it can't be ‘used to stifle expression’</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Senators <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1865411937183428834" data-original-link="https://x.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1865411937183428834"><ins>Richard Blumenthal</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1865399988894957638" data-original-link="https://x.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1865399988894957638"><ins>Marsha Blackburn</ins></a> announced on Saturday that they’ve made changes to the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) with help from X to “strengthen the bill while safeguarding free speech online and ensuring it is not used to stifle expression.” The Senate <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-senate-just-passed-two-landmark-bills-aimed-at-protecting-minors-online-170935128.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/the-senate-just-passed-two-landmark-bills-aimed-at-protecting-minors-online-170935128.html"><ins>passed the bill in July</ins></a> with a vote of 91-3, but it’s since stalled in the House, and its proponents are pushing for it to be passed before the end of the year. X’s CEO Linda Yaccarino also posted about the collaboration, and called for Congress and the House to pass the bill.</p>
<p>“After working with the bill authors, I’m proud to share that we’ve made progress to further protect freedom of speech while maintaining safety for minors online,” <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1865398245192540560" data-original-link="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1865398245192540560"><ins>Yaccarino</ins></a> wrote in a post on X that was shared by the two senators. KOSA is meant to protect minors from “addictive” social media features and potentially dangerous content by placing a “duty of care” on the companies that own the platforms. But critics have argued that it could lead to censorship and other harms. The new changes, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315520/kids-online-safety-act-kosa-x-update-johnson-scalise" data-original-link="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315520/kids-online-safety-act-kosa-x-update-johnson-scalise"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a><em>, </em>clarify the conditions under which duty of care can be enforced and narrow its application around anxiety and depressive disorders, stating they must be “objectively verifiable” and tied to “compulsive usage.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In their joint statement, Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) and Blackburn (R-Tennessee) said:</p>
<blockquote><p>These changes should eliminate once and for all the false narrative that this bill would be weaponized by unelected bureaucrats to censor Americans. We thank Elon and Linda for their bold leadership and commitment to protecting children online and for helping us get this bill across the finish line this Congress. We appreciate that this endorsement and revised text reflects their publicly stated goal of furthering free speech without fear of censorship. We reiterate X’s call to pass KOSA by the end of the year — it is clear that this legislation has overwhelming support from Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>KOSA was first introduced in February 2022 and has faced opposition from groups including the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It’s been revised multiple times.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-helped-senators-update-the-kids-online-safety-act-so-it-cant-be-used-to-stifle-expression-221853260.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Fortnite is getting a 5v5 first-person shooter mode</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>A new game mode called Ballistic is coming to <em>Fortnite</em> in early access on December 11, bringing a 5v5 tactical first-person shooter experience. In Ballistic mode, one team will be tasked with planting a Rift Point Device — which will detonate 45 seconds after it’s placed — and the other team will have to stop that from happening. There will be one map (Skyline 10) to start and a limited selection of weapons and items, but more will be added down the line in “major updates” to come, according to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" data-original-link="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11"><ins>Fortnite blog</ins></a> post.</p>
<p>“Ballistic is a no-build mode,” the Fortnite team says. “All saved presets from your Locker will carry over into Ballistic, which supports existing <em>Fortnite</em> Outfits, Back Blings, Kicks, Wraps, Sprays, and Emotes! Pickaxes, Contrails, Instruments, Vehicles, and Jam Tracks are not used/supported.” If you get taken out during a round, you won’t be able to respawn. But, you’ll come back in the next round. The teams’ roles will swap after six rounds, and the match will end once one team has won seven rounds. You’ll be able to play Ranked or Unranked.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ballistic mode will be available everywhere you can play <em>Fortnite</em>, except in South Korea and Russia, but the team says it’s “working to make Ballistic available in both regions.” Since it’s early access, players’ feedback will be used to improve the experience as it expands.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/fortnite-is-getting-a-5v5-first-person-shooter-mode-162200195.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Engadget Wrapped: The music we listened to the most in 2024</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Spotify's 2024 Wrapped results arrived this week, and while the whole package seems a bit thin compared to previous years, we're still getting a kick out of seeing our listening habits laid bare. Apple Music also dropped its annual Replay, and Tidal's 2024 Rewind has landed, so non-Spotify users have some data to pore over too. For those among us who don't use any of the big streaming apps, well, it's still a nice time to reflect on personal favorites from this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the Engadget team's most listened-to songs, artists and albums in 2024 (and how we feel about those picks).&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2 id="jump-link-spotify-wrapped">Spotify Wrapped&nbsp;</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/4f546020-b350-11ef-9fbf-3f529513be39" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/4f546020-b350-11ef-9fbf-3f529513be39" style="height:954px;width:720px;" alt="A screenshot from Spotify wrapped showing the album cover for Ariana Grande's Eternal Sunshine above a list of top artists — Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Sabrina Carpenter, Usher and The Weeknd — and Top Songs: Yes, and?, don't wanna break up again, supernatural, the boy is mine, and Boyfriend" data-uuid="717ea620-1930-366b-995b-d54834d5322c"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>I hate to add to the list because of all the controversy around Spotify recently, but I have to say that the layoffs at the company do seem to have impacted how accurate I found my Wrapped report to be. While I certainly have listened to a lot of Ariana Grande in 2024 (I even <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-were-listening-to-the-tortured-poets-department-and-eternal-sunshine-150035421.html">wrote about it</a> for our site!), I felt that the sections on what I was listening to in August were inaccurate. According to Spotify I was vibing to Rose and Bruno Mars' <em>APT </em>in August, but didn't that song get released quite a bit later?</p>
<p>Anyway, judge me or don't judge me based on my listening — all I can say is the data feels incorrect and incomplete but also fun and inconsequential. <em>— Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor, Reviews</em></p>

<p>I was pretty ill this year, and I spent hours in hospital and clinic waiting rooms listening to music on Spotify. Apparently, March was my "Pink Pilates Princess Strut Pop" phase, because I mostly listened to Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande and Charli xcx. My top artist for the year, however, was Fujii Kaze, whose music gave me a lot of comfort when I needed it the most. <em>— Mariella Moon, Contributing Reporter</em></p>

<h2 id="jump-link-apple-music-replay">Apple Music Replay</h2>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/0224fe80-b34c-11ef-a5fe-fc7689790445" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/0224fe80-b34c-11ef-a5fe-fc7689790445" style="height:1981px;width:1179px;" alt="A screenshot showing the Top Albums from a 2024 Apple Replay: GNX by Kendrick Lamar, BRAT by Charli xcx, GRASA by Nathy Peluso, Cowboy Carter by Beyonce and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) by Eminem" data-uuid="381bfe8b-81e8-3b41-bd53-11deee5399dd"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've had <em>GNX</em> on repeat since it came out, and it was one of the things that got me through our incredibly busy Black Friday coverage season. Very excited to see which of these tracks gets played live at the Super Bowl. My guess is we’ll get “tv off” (with at least one “Mustard!” shout) and “squabble up,” at the least.</p>
<p>Brat summer became Brat autumn, and it will continue to be a Brat winter for me. Top tracks: “Club classics,” “Sympathy is a knife,” and “365.”</p>
<p><em>Grasa</em> is my true album of the year and it’s a must-listen for any urbano latino fans. It’s fantastic experienced as an album from start to finish, and any edit you make based on personal preference is sure to be excellent. My favorite tracks — “Legendario,” “Manhattan,” “Menina” — are still on repeat in my personal playlists and will be carried over into 2025.</p>
<p>While <em>Renaissance</em> remains my preferred album in this Beyonce cycle so far, <em>Cowboy Carter </em>has no skips. “Daughter,” “Spaghetti” and “Sweet Honey Buckin’” are my faves.</p>
<p><em>The Death of Slim Shady</em> makes sense as a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/eminem-the-death-of-slim-shady-conceptual-album-1235729000/" data-original-link="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/eminem-the-death-of-slim-shady-conceptual-album-1235729000/">concept album</a> to me and I think it succeeds as such. But “Tobey” is what really prompted me to give the entire album a listen when it came out, and I’m glad I did. “Tobey” remains a top track for me, along with “Renaissance” and “Somebody Save Me.” —<em>Valentina Palladino, Deputy Editor, Buying Advice</em></p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/d3324f50-b414-11ef-99ff-1f862b49cbfb" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/d3324f50-b414-11ef-99ff-1f862b49cbfb" style="height:1394px;width:1572px;" alt="Two side by side screenshots from Apple Music Replay showing 5 top albums — Daughter's Stereo Mind Game, TOOL's Fear Inoculum, David Gilmour's Luck and Strange, The Beaches' Blame My Ex, and Pearl Jam's Dark Matter — and 5 top songs: The Beaches' Blame Brett, and Intro, Be On Your Way, Party, and Dandelion by Daughter" data-uuid="9059b9c7-2304-3cf9-8447-01cf488a263a"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the fact that music streaming services push you to playlists and radio channels, I remain an Album Guy. And as usual, my top album of the year didn’t come out this year, though it’s a relatively recent release. Daughter’s <em>Stereo Mind Game</em> was near the top of my list last year, but this April it rocketed up my list and was an obsession for the rest of the summer. That is thanks in large part to a live studio session they released on YouTube that was the only chance I had to hear these songs performed in a somewhat live setting, as Daughter didn’t tour <em>Stereo Mind Game</em> at all.</p>
<div id="55d3e6da5b24415583900231b5fa67db"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkbbI13GXgU?si=AEZgBv8R1IrFpOHB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>And since I’m an album guy, the first four songs on the album were my second-through-fifth most played songs of 2024. The absurdly catchy “Blame Brett” by Canadian pop-rockers The Beaches was number one, from their excellent <em>Blame My Ex</em> album that also came out last year. I got obsessed with that album in late 2023 and it definitely carried over to the first half of 2024. The same thing happened with Tool’s 2019 opus <em>Fear Inoculum</em> — I saw the band in November of 2023 for the first time in 21 years, and got re-obsessed and continued playing it throughout the year.</p>
<p>Finally, something new from a very old favorite: David Gilmour, best known as the guitarist and co-lead songwriter of the legendary Pink Floyd, released his first solo album in nine years. He followed that with a very short tour that hit only four cities, New York City included. I was lucky enough to go see him a few weeks ago — at 78, this could easily be the last tour he ever does, but he still brings it. He’s my favorite guitar player of all time, and the last song “Scattered” on <em>Luck and Strange</em> is an all-time great as good as almost anything else he’s done.</p>
<p>Bringing up the rear is another new album from an old favorite, Pearl Jam. More than 30 years after their debut<em> Ten,</em> they still know how to make a damn good rock album. Both Pearl Jam and Gilmour went with producers much younger than they were, trying to find people who weren’t going to be beholden with the work they had done earlier in long and impressive careers. If you ask me, it worked out in both cases.</p>
<p>There are tons of other albums from much younger or less established artists I played all year long, including Bathe Alone’s <em>I Don’t Do Humidity,</em> Adrienne Lenker’s <em>Bright Future</em>, Billie Eilish’s <em>Hit Me Hard and Soft</em>, Medium Build’s <em>Country,</em> Girl in Red’s <em>I’m Doing It Again Baby! </em>and Waxahatchee’s <em>Tigers Blood.</em> They’re all worth a listen —&nbsp;but apparently this was a year for comfort and familiarity when I put things on repeat. <em>— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor, News</em></p>

<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/7747fe90-b3ee-11ef-9fff-d63feba93d6b" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/7747fe90-b3ee-11ef-9fff-d63feba93d6b" style="height:1875px;width:1055px;" alt="A screenshot of Tidal's 2024 rewind showing Top Artists — Ariana Grande, Orville Peck, Uncle Acid &amp; the Deadbeats, Chappell Roan and Baroness — and Top songs: eternal sunshine, supernatural, saturn returns interlude, don't wanna break up again, and true story" data-uuid="fea92929-528d-30fe-aa24-ce90c2702dd4"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>This year for me was apparently all about fixating on a handful of new songs and playing them to absolute death. And, um, Ariana Grande. I don’t have Spotify, but my Tidal year-end playlist has every single song from <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> at the top, and I’m slightly ashamed to say I can't argue the validity of that — I had that album on a loop for months after it came out. She’s really talented, okay?? After that my most listened-to songs were “Cry For Me” by Castle Rat, “Bloom” by Baroness (probably an all-time favorite song for me, really), “How Far Will We Take It?” by Orville Peck and Noah Cyrus, “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eilish, “Weird World” by Allie X and “Red Wine Supernova” by Chappell Roan. I... contain multitudes...&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a suspicious overall lack of emo on my 2024 wrap-up though, so I’m going to take these results with a huge grain of salt. I mean, my go-to playlist is titled “rawr xD.” — <em>Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor</em></p>

<p>I don't have Spotify, so any recollection of particularly sticky music for me will necessarily be imprecise and skewed by recency bias. With that said: hooooooly moly can we talk about <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LJi5na897Y" data-original-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LJi5na897Y">that Cindy Lee album</a>?? My journey with <em>Diamond Jubilee</em> went something like this:</p>
<p>-What is this?</p>
<p>-No really, what is this??</p>
<p>-Why can't I listen to anything besides this???</p>
<p>Its two hours of runtime play out like a secret radio station beaming some alternate version of '60s girl groups into 2024 and I absolutely fell in love with it — and that was before even realizing Pat Flegel was in Women (another extremely cool, but very different band).</p>

        <title>‘Gun control is dead, and we killed it’: the growing threat of firearms that can be made at home</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>One far-right cell wanted to use 3D-printed guns to cause ‘maximum confusion and fear’ on the streets of Finland. Could the police intercept them in time?</p><p></p><p>Long before he started making guns with a 3D printer, Viljam Nyman was a kid who was bullied. In a document police later found on his computer, titled “The life story of how I became a far-right extremist”, Nyman described his childhood in Lahti, a city in southern Finland, being picked on by other kids and feeling abandoned by the adults around him. He wrote that this experience taught him something: “‘Be yourself’ or ‘don’t care’ were really bad pieces of advice. Violence and power, or the threat of using it, were actually the things that mattered. Equality and accepting difference were just words on paper, naive and idealistic fantasies. Human nature, in reality, was discriminatory and racist.”</p><p>In 2005, when Nyman was 11, violent protests broke out in a number of European countries after a Danish newspaper published 12 cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in response to a debate about Islam and self-censorship. Why was it, Nyman wondered, that he was mocked for being different and no one did anything about it, but criticising a religion from faraway countries was off limits? He wrote in the document that “all of this” reinforced his belief that something was wrong with society and no one was on his side. Nyman became obsessed with Hitler and Nazi Germany. He began with the notion that bullies could be classified as subhuman and sent to camps, but became fascinated by the discipline and order of the Third Reich. As he got older, he immersed himself in online message boards that shared antisemitic theories. Until this point, Nyman had spent a lot of time playing video games. Now, he thought, he needed to do more so that he would not be a disgrace to the white race. He started to feel something he had not felt before: a sense of purpose.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/07/gun-control-is-dead-and-we-killed-it-firearms-that-can-be-printed-at-home">Continue reading...</a>]]></description>

        <title>Google Wallet can now hold your US passport</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Now you’ve got one less thing you have to fish for in your pocket or purse at the airport. Starting today, Google Wallet can carry a digital copy of your US passport and use them at Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) checkpoints.</p>
<p>If you want to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-update-september-2024/"><ins>add your passport</ins></a> to Google’s virtual wallet, first you’ll need to download the Google Wallet app and log into your account or create one. Check the prompt “create an ID pass with your US passport” and follow the instructions. The app will ask you to take a video selfie to verify your identity and scan the security chip in your passport. It should only take a few minutes for Google to confirm your identity.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Your digital passport won’t work at every airport. Currently, there are 27 states (and Puerto Rico) with at least one airport that accepts digital forms of identification. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/digital-id/map#texas"><ins>The TSA website</ins></a> can show you which states and airports accept digital IDs.</p>

Several states have started accepting digital IDs just in the last few months. <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/new-mexico-state-ids-can-now-be-added-to-digital-wallets-211549853.html"><ins>New Mexico</ins></a> is the newest state to accept digital IDs including driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet and Google Wallet.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/google-wallet-can-now-hold-your-us-passport-215133683.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>SpaceX completes Starlink’s first direct-to-cell constellation</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-launches-20-starlink-satellites-to-orbit-from-california" data-original-link="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-launches-20-starlink-satellites-to-orbit-from-california">completed</a> its first Starlink direct-to-cell satellite constellation this week. On Wednesday, the company launched 20 satellites aboard a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-13-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-has-300-launches-before-retirement.html">Falcon 9 rocket</a>, 13 of which can communicate directly with cell phones without extra equipment.</p>
<p>The completed constellation follows <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/science/space/t-mobile-and-spacexs-satellite-to-phone-service-gets-fcc-approval-134501756.html">the FCC’s approval</a> of a deal between SpaceX and T-Mobile last week. The companies <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-starlink-partnership-012539605.html">announced the partnership</a> in 2022, touting plans for a future where phones can be connected to the world even in the middle of the ocean. SpaceX <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell" data-original-link="https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell">says</a> the satellite constellation acts “like a cellphone tower in space, allowing network integration similar to a standard roaming partner.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Thursday, SpaceX <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1864723952540746122">posted</a> on X that the direct-to-cell satellites will “immediately connect over laser backhaul to the Starlink constellation, eliminate dead zones and provide peace of mind when customers need it most.” The company <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-and-t-mobile-send-the-first-text-messages-from-orbiting-starlink-satellites-103526219.html">sent and received its first text messages</a> through T-Mobile’s network early this year.</p>
<p>The low-earth-orbit constellation has 6,799 operational satellites, and <em>Space.com</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-launches-20-starlink-satellites-to-orbit-from-california" data-original-link="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-launches-20-starlink-satellites-to-orbit-from-california">reports</a> that about 330 can communicate directly with cell phones. On Thursday, Elon Musk said unmodified cell phones would enjoy a bandwidth of around 10Mbps per beam. He said future constellations will be capable of much greater throughput.</p>
<p>The companies will presumably go into more detail for consumers once Starlink Direct to Cell is available. It’s currently <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell" data-original-link="https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell">targeted</a> for next year. However, the constellation isn’t locked into T-Mobile alone. <em>Android Central</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/starlink-direct-to-cell-open-to-any-telecom-says-spacex-exec" data-original-link="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/starlink-direct-to-cell-open-to-any-telecom-says-spacex-exec">reports</a> that SpaceX senior director Ben Longmier said shortly after the deployment that the satellites are “open for business for any teleco in the world.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-completes-starlinks-first-direct-to-cell-constellation-212549713.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>The next iPhone SE’s new modem reportedly won’t be as capable as Qualcomm’s</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>It seems increasingly likely that Apple’s fourth-generation iPhone SE will feature <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-reportedly-debut-its-in-house-5g-modem-with-the-iphone-se-4-103023682.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-reportedly-debut-its-in-house-5g-modem-with-the-iphone-se-4-103023682.html"><ins>the first 5G modem</ins></a> the company has built in-house.

<p>The new modem, reportedly called “Sinope” won’t support <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-how-5g-makes-use-of-millimeter-waves.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-how-5g-makes-use-of-millimeter-waves.html"><ins>mmWave</ins></a>, the short-range 5G technology Verizon offers that can theoretically reach speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second. It also will only offer four-carrier aggregation as opposed to Qualcomm’s six, “a technology that combines bands from several wireless providers simultaneously to increase network capacity and speeds,” <em>Bloomberg </em>says.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple’s modem will instead be focused on providing Sub-6 5G, the more common standard that’s already supported on <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-se-3-2022-review-battery-life-camera-sample-touch-id-home-button-130047678-130047247.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-se-3-2022-review-battery-life-camera-sample-touch-id-home-button-130047678-130047247.html"><ins>the current iPhone SE</ins></a>, which was released in 2022. In testing, Apple’s new modem reportedly “caps out at download speeds of about 4 gigabits per second,” slower than Qualcomm’s current mmWave models, but the difference is easier to justify on a cheaper device and might not be that noticeable anyway. The goal is ultimately to achieve even tighter integration between the modem and other components of the phone to offer more important benefits than just download speed, like improved battery life.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg </em>writes that launching on the iPhone SE first is how Apple plans on managing the risks of its new hardware gamble. Debuting on the iPhone 17 Pro would be a mark of confidence, but most people expect a phone that costs upwards of $1000 to work without issues. Until Apple can guarantee that, the SE makes sense as a modem guinea pig. That won’t be the case for long, however. “Ganymede,” Apple’s second-generation modem, should be ready for the iPhone 18 in 2026 and match Qualcomm’s current offerings with mmWave support and faster download speeds. In 2027, the company’s “Prometheus” modem is aiming to surpass Qualcomm entirely in “performance and artificial intelligence features.”</p>

This would mark the first time a Mac had onboard cellular, though the iPad has had the option since day one.</p>
<p>There’s still years before any of that happens, and the road to even get here has been long and winding. For one, Apple’s relationship with Qualcomm has been up and down. The companies were in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-15-apple-qualcomm-patent-lawsuit-jury-ruling.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-15-apple-qualcomm-patent-lawsuit-jury-ruling.html"><ins>a legal spat over patent violations</ins></a> that ultimately<a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-16-apple-and-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-16-apple-and-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute.html"><ins> led to a settlement</ins></a> and a licensing deal in 2019.

        <title>Get trapped on a pirate ship or in Dracula’s castle in Escape Simulator 2</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>The first<em> Escape Simulator </em>solved the biggest problem with VR puzzle games. Once you’ve solved everything, the game’s over. Unless you can erase specific memories a la <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind </em>style, there’s zero replayability.</p>
<p>Pine Studio’s <em>Escape Simulator</em> added a custom builder mode where the community could build and share their own escape rooms with other players. Since the Internet has some of the most imaginative and insane minds on the planet creating custom games for the world, <em>Escape Simulator</em> is one of the few virtual puzzle games that you can keep playing. Now, <em>Escape Simulator 2 </em>is heading our way on Steam, and it’s got some new and potentially cool worlds to get stuck in by yourself or with friends.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="13e8aad8455047c892dc0eb94a0ff756"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gsl4DvPyJs4?si=ZpbJAsU4Cxc8DtxY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p><em>Escape Simulator 2 </em>has some impressive-looking environments that can hold up to eight players at once. So far, the game will have 12 brand new escape rooms. A new trailer that dropped today shows three of the new escape room environments including a stranded spaceship, Count Dracula’s castle and a cursed pirate ship.</p>
<p>The room editor mode also has a bunch of new toys, props and tools to create puzzles for the game’s growing community of escape addicts. Pine Studio also announced that <em>Escape Simulator 2’s </em>custom room maker has “a brand new lighting engine, building constructor and animation editor,” according to a press release. There’s no release date or price yet, but there’s <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2/"><ins>a Steam page</ins></a> for the game up right now.</p>

<p>Look. Grok isn’t the most advanced chatbot on the planet. All LLMs <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-butchering-reporting-news-partners">make mistakes</a>, but Grok <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/xs-ai-bot-is-so-dumb-it-cant-tell-the-difference-between-a-bad-game-and-vandalism-172707401.html">is particularly prone to them</a>.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Meta’s aggressive push to make its AI assistant a ubiquitous presence in its apps continues to pay off. Meta AI is on the verge of passing its next major milestone, with “nearly” 600 million monthly users, Mark Zuckerberg shared in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DDPna9zvh_r" data-original-link="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DDPna9zvh_r"><ins>an update</ins></a>.

<p>The update came alongside <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.llama.com/" data-original-link="https://www.llama.com/">the release</a> of Meta’s latest Llama 3.3 70B model. According to Meta, the latest text model has “similar performance to the Llama 3.1 405B model,” but comes “at a fraction of the cost.” Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta posted a chart on X that showed Llama 3.3 scored higher on several benchmarks compared with Google’s Gemini Pro 1.5 and OpenAI’s GPT-4o.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg also briefly teased the next major release. “The next stop is Llama 4,” Zuckerberg said in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDPm9gqv2cW/" data-original-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDPm9gqv2cW/"><ins>a video</ins></a> shared on Instagram, after noting that the 3.3 release was the “last big AI update of the year.” Zuckerberg has so far has been fairly tight-lipped about what’s in store for Llama 4, though he's offered some hints.

        <title>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown is the first turn-based game in the franchise's long history</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>There’s a new TMNT game in town, and it’s unlike anything the franchise has attempted before. <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, as the name suggests, is a turn-based strategy RPG. This means that players will control characters on a grid-based map, with each turn representing movement or an action of some sort.</p>
<div id="06e819e52fb64328893cc1dfce4a3b3d"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?si=-O-wfcOjAE4IIp8L" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>There’s one thing that sets this game apart from its SRPG cousins. Battles take “minutes” to complete, which is a far cry from the time-consuming affairs <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/unicorn-overlord-review-a-must-play-for-tactics-fans-173259209.html"><ins>found in games like </ins><em><ins>Unicorn Overlord</ins></em></a>. From the trailer, the fights look even zippier than the Mario + Rabbids series. Also, players control each turtle independently on a solo campaign before teaming up to take on a boss.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The graphics look cartoony and on-brand, bringing to mind a tabletop session with D&amp;D miniatures. It looks like all of the turtle’s favorite hang out spots are represented here, from the sewers to the NYC subway system. This could be a neat way to bring new players into the genre.</p>

<p>This is a unique entry in the TMNT franchise, but it’s also a new type of game for developer Scaffold Games. This is the company that brought us the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/clickolding-from-the-i-am-your-beast-devs-looks-like-a-clicking-nightmare-180504296.html"><ins>absolutely disturbing </ins><em><ins>Clickholding</ins></em></a> and the third-person shooter <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/even-the-indie-game-el-paso-elsewhere-is-getting-turned-into-a-movie-191423219.html"><em><ins>El Paso, Elsewhere</ins></em></a>. The company also made <em>I Am Your Beast</em> and <em>Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</em>. None of these titles are turn-based tactical RPGs.</p>
<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> will be released for PCs sometime next year. You can preorder the game <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/"><ins>right now via Steam</ins></a>. Publisher Paramount Game Studios hasn’t said anything about a potential console release, so perhaps hold off on organizing that pizza party.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-is-the-first-turn-based-game-in-the-franchises-long-history-175730833.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>TikTok inches closer to a US ban after judges shoot down appeal</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Three judges shot down ByteDance’s petition to overturn a law that could ban TikTok in the US. On Friday, <em>The New York Times</em> <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/media/tiktok-ban-court-decision.html" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/business/media/tiktok-ban-court-decision.html">reported</a> that the judges upheld the new law, which requires the company to sell the app to a non-Chinese company by January 19 or face a ban.</p>
<p>ByteDance argued that the law unfairly targets TikTok and that a ban would violate users’ First Amendment rights. The company has said a sale is impossible because the Chinese government would block it. In 2020, the country <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/technology/china-tiktok-export-controls.html" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/technology/china-tiktok-export-controls.html">updated</a> export control rules to give it more say over a potential transaction.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement to Engadget, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said it was disappointed in the decision. “Restricting the free flow of information, even from foreign adversaries, is fundamentally undemocratic,” an EFF spokesperson wrote. “Until now, the U.S. has championed the free flow of information and called out other nations when they have shut down internet access or banned online communications tools like social media apps."</p>
<p>ByteDance’s options from here include appealing to the US Supreme Court (although there’s no guarantee they would take the case) or hoping President-elect Donald Trump follows through on a vague promise to “deliver” on a plan to save the app. ByteDance <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1865080490161492208">suggested</a> on Friday that the decision amounted to censorship, saying it expects the Supreme Court to protect “Americans' right to free speech.”</p>
<p>The <em>NYT</em> reports that legal experts don’t see much of a legal path for Trump to rescue the app after taking office on January 20, 2025. During his first term, he <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-wechat-executive-order-014615752.html">issued executive orders restricting American dealings</a> with the app, citing national security concerns and suggesting the app could be a Trojan Horse for data harvesting by the Chinese government. Microsoft was <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-september-trump-001655945.html">ready and willing to buy it</a> if given the chance. The ban faced a series of legal challenges, and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-revokes-trump-tiktok-wechat-orders-144643108.html">President Biden revoked the order</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>Trump reversed his position in early 2024, reportedly after <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-tiktok-ban-reversal-after-meeting-megadonor-stake/story?id=108013785" data-original-link="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-tiktok-ban-reversal-after-meeting-megadonor-stake/story?id=108013785">meeting</a> with a Republican megadonor with a significant financial stake in the app. The president-elect’s shift intensified after <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-signs-the-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-the-united-states-154106950.html">Biden signed the law</a> that could lead to its ban in early 2025.

        <title>Crypto evangelist David Sacks will serve as Trump's AI and cryptocurrency advisor</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has picked a crypto bull to advise him on AI and cryptocurrency policy. On Thursday evening, the president-elect <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113603133222686186">took to Truth Social</a> to share that he was appointing former PayPal COO David Sacks to serve as his “White House A.I. &amp; Crypto Czar.” Trump said Sacks would also lead the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology.</p>
<p>“David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” Trump wrote, adding Sacks would “safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p>
<p>As an appointee to one of the president’s advisory councils, Sacks does not need to go through the usual Senate confirmation process required for cabinet picks and federal agency leads. Sacks does not have previous government experience. Trump instead highlighted his business credentials, pointing to his tenure at PayPal and later Yammer, which Sacks founded in 2008 and Microsoft acquired in 2012 for $1.2 billion. Sacks is also a close confidant of Elon Musk and provided part of the funding Musk used to buy Twitter for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-elon-musk-buyout-offer-decision-185307689.html">$44 billion in 2022</a>. Sacks has broadly advocated for smaller government and less regulation, though he also pushed hard for the Biden administration to intervene when Silicon Valley Bank became insolvent in 2023.</p>
<div id="c3ab9711d4d6440d802b82e42ad6ac12"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">congrats to czar <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSacks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DavidSacks</a>!</p>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1864861265488941151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>“Where is Powell? Where is Yellen?” Sacks tweeted before regulators moved to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/us-regulators-will-protect-all-deposits-at-silicon-valley-bank-045837677.html">fully protect deposits at SVB</a>. “Stop this crisis NOW. Announce that all depositors will be safe. Place SVB with a Top 4 bank. Do this before Monday open or there will be contagion and the crisis will spread.”</p>
<p>Alongside <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-picks-former-sec-commissioner-paul-atkins-run-agency-2024-12-04/">Paul Atkins</a>, who Trump picked to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sacks is likely to reshape US policy on cryptocurrency and AI. Under the Biden administration, the federal government sought to regulate the crypto industry. Sacks, however, is a vocal proponent of the industry. He is also a major investor in Solana and other crypto-related ventures such as Multicoin Capital.</p>
<p>As for Trump, appointing Sacks to his advisory council shows just how much his stance on crypto has changed. As <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/donald-trump-bitcoin-scam-regulated-cryptocurrency">recently as 2021</a>, he said he thought Bitcoin seemed “like a scam,” and advocated for “very, very high” government regulation of the currency. That was before the crypto industry <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/17/politics/crypto-industry-donald-trump-reelection/index.html">funneled $131 million</a> during the 2024 election to get 274 pro-crypto candidates elected to the House of Representatives and 20 candidates to the Senate. During his campaign, Trump promised to make the United States “the crypto capital of the planet.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/crypto-evangelist-david-sacks-will-serve-as-trumps-ai-and-cryptocurrency-advisor-170522273.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Google prolongs the lifespan of the Pixel Fold, 6 and 7 with extended OS updates</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Google has delivered a surprise holiday gift to folks with a Pixel 6, Pixel 7 or <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-fold-durability-report-one-year-later-more-durable-than-i-expected-133037946.html"><ins>Pixel Fold</ins></a>. The company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/madebygoogle/status/1864794840673980452"><ins>says</ins></a> it will give those devices two extra years of OS upgrades. The handsets were originally slated to get three years of OS updates and five years of security patches, but now it's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314389/google-pixel-6-7-fold-update-schedule-android-16-17" data-original-link="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314389/google-pixel-6-7-fold-update-schedule-android-16-17">five for each</a>, starting from when the devices first hit the Google Store in the US.</p>
<p>As the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro debuted in October 2021, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/android-15-is-starting-to-roll-out-on-pixel-devices-160039591.html"><ins>Android 15</ins></a> was slated to be the last big OS update for those smartphones. However, they'll now get an extra two years of fresh features, giving them an extended lease on life. The move might work against Google's business interests to a degree, as it could dissuade those who are clinging onto a Pixel 6, 6a, 6 Pro, 7, 7a, 7 Pro or Fold from upgrading anytime soon.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="cc46c0cf50444736abd3c067ec1103c0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And ICYMI, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PixelFold?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PixelFold</a> along with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Pixel6</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Pixel7</a> generation users will now get two additional years of OS updates!

<p>Google has shifted away from having one big annual feature dump with the release of a major new Android version each fall. Instead, the company is now peppering the rollout of new features throughout the year with <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/new-pixel-updates-include-ai-powered-theft-protection-160042706.html"><ins>Pixel drops</ins></a>. To that end, Google suggested on a  <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold"><ins>support page</ins></a> that the Pixel 6, 7 and Fold's extra OS updates "may also include new and upgraded features with Pixel Drops."</p>
<p>Starting with last year's Pixel 8 lineup, Google promises <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-extends-software-support-for-pixel-phones-to-a-full-seven-years-143043262.html"><ins>seven years of OS and security updates</ins></a> for its devices — in large part to comply with the software requirements of a California right-to-repair law that <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/californias-right-to-repair-bill-is-now-californias-right-to-repair-law-232526782.html"><ins>came into force in this year</ins></a>. Pixel 6, 7 and Fold users aren't getting quite that lengthy period of support, but this is still a positive step for sustainability.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-prolongs-the-lifespan-of-the-pixel-fold-6-and-7-with-extended-os-updates-164712505.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Riot is making a physical League of Legends TCG, and it's not LoR</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Riot just announced a trading card game (TCG) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1j7zvA3Sy0"><ins>based on </ins><em><ins>League of Legend</ins></em><ins>s</ins></a>. It’s called Project K and looks like a whole lot of fun. The cards look exquisitely-drawn and pull from IPs throughout the wider LoL universe, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-drops-a-proper-trailer-for-arcanes-second-and-last-season-210424128.html"><ins>including the Netflix hit </ins><em><ins>Arcane</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Project K is not a physical version of the pre-existing digital card game <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, though it does use some characters and locations from that one. It’s a brand-new thing that the creators say is designed “for everyone who loves card games, collecting and connecting with friends across the table.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3ea7abf9ed424f6dbf8a09c09597b769"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1j7zvA3Sy0?si=NFiVoYvyZXvL1Dtz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>To that end, there are multiple game modes to suit different types of players. Like many trading card games, players can form unique decks that encourage particular playstyles. For instance, a Jinx deck, from <em>Arcane</em>, is useful for causing “as much mayhem as possible.” That’s kind of her whole thing.</p>
<p>If this seems familiar, that’s because Riot teased a card game for China earlier this year, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNfybpK9jn8"><ins>called </ins><em><ins>Rune Battleground</ins></em></a>. This looks like it could be the very same game, based on some of the art accompanying the back of the cards as seen in both trailers.</p>
<div id="226d54e3107e418184ab69d7e262305d"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNfybpK9jn8?si=bnnCDrrkl93-Z_zO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Now on to some bad news. Riot already has a publishing partner for China, but not in the rest of the world. It’s currently looking for a US-based partner. This will likely delay the game’s release a bit, though it’s coming out in China early next year. Despite this hiccup, the company says it’ll be opening up preorders for an Arcane Box Set of the game in the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/riot-is-making-a-physical-league-of-legends-tcg-and-its-not-lor-162923406.html?src=rss]]></description>

It can get toasty under load, and the memory isn't upgradeable, but this config can still handle more demanding games at high settings and the native 2.8K resolution without much trouble. It includes a Ryzen 9 8945HS chip, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and an RTX 4070 GPU. Outside of one drop to $1,600 back in July, this ties the best price we’ve seen.</p></li>

You can pick up a pair for $139, which is $40 off the list price.</p> 
<p>While we think the AirPods Pro 2 are the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html"><ins>best AirPods</ins></a> overall, the ANC-enabled AirPods 4 are still a solid choice. We gave them a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apple-airpods-4-review-pro-features-for-everyone-120032046.html"><ins>score of 86 in our review</ins></a>.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

 <core-commerce id="fe4eea527749439b84bf29fe5f478754" data-type="product-list" data-original-url="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1"></core-commerce></p> 
<p>Apple released two AirPods variants a few months ago, one with ANC and the other without. We gave the ANC-less model a score of 88 as they had a number of improvements over the previous generation AirPods while still being fairly affordable and delivering great bang for your buck.</p> 
<p>Of course, the lack of ANC in the base model is a negative. The other variant delivers effective ANC performance overall. Other upgrades over the base model include Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode. The AirPods 4 with ANC (unlike the base option) also have a charging case that supports MagSafe and Qi-compatible wireless charging, as well as a built-in speaker that emits beeps when you activate Find My.</p> 
<p>One of our main reservations about the AirPods 4 with ANC is that the superior AirPods Pro 2 (which typically cost $249) often go on sale — we've seen them dip to $169. That's cheaper than the list price of the AirPods 4 with ANC. However, this discount makes those AirPods easier to recommend.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the base AirPods 4 have <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=82808622-9444-42f5-a40a-83d4bd9bf4f9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwREdITU5RNVovP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgyODA4NjIyLTk0NDQtNDJmNS1hNDBhLTgzZDRiZDliZjRmOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMERHSE1OUTVaLyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb8hysEvB6BFvSaHXQvBvdB6ON-bgG3GQPY4eECQ2tZY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHMNQ5Z%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/"><ins>dropped to $119</ins></a>.

        <title>Google Photos now has a 2024 recap feature</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Google Photos just unveiled a yearly recap feature, which is a play on <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-wrapped-2024-includes-ai-hosted-podcasts-discussing-your-listening-habits-130002140.html">stuff like Spotify Wrapped</a> and PlayStation Wrap-Up. This is a highlight reel of notable photos culled from the entire year, along with “fun graphics and cinematic effects.” I can’t wait to see snazzed-up photos of my cats.</p>
<p>In addition to random graphics and effects, the system will also generate captions to help denote two important events from the year for each user. These captions will be generated by Gemini, though users have to opt in. Google gave us examples of attending a wedding and taking a trip to Seoul.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/3773e800-b33b-11ef-9f3b-1d9ae59fdc98" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/3773e800-b33b-11ef-9f3b-1d9ae59fdc98" style="height:686px;width:971px;" alt="Yearly recap tool." data-uuid="93059137-5e8c-3682-9856-70e6a000b807"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google </div></figure>
<p>The Recap feature will even provide “insights” in the form of tidbits about a particular user’s photo-taking habits. This could detail anything from a favorite color to the person a user smiles the most with. Google also promises that Recap will detail a user&#39;s “2024 vibes.” The vibes of 2024? Yikes.</p>
<p>Just like rival yearly recap tools, folks can easily share everything to social media platforms. There’s also a little bit of a competitive element here, as each link will include data as to a particular user’s longest photo streak. Nothing creates more bragging rights than saying “you only took 560 photos this year, whereas I took 570.”</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/dbd43f90-b33a-11ef-bfe9-64401acda916" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/dbd43f90-b33a-11ef-bfe9-64401acda916" style="height:688px;width:1027px;" alt="Year in review image." data-uuid="891c3074-0e0e-3c5b-96d9-b42b5b9ee2a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure>
<p>This feature is rolling out right now to all users. Just look for a notification from Google Photos that says it&#39;s ready to view. The app also recently added a tool to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-photos-will-show-when-images-have-been-modified-with-ai-180007494.html">detect images that have been manipulated</a> by AI and, uh, other tools to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-will-use-generative-ai-to-straight-up-change-your-images-171014939.html">manipulate photos by using AI</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/google-photos-now-has-a-2024-recap-feature-150037384.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>iFixit now carries official Xbox replacement parts</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>As part of a deal it struck with Microsoft <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ifixit-now-sells-official-replacement-parts-for-microsoft-surface-devices-173050519.html">last year</a>, iFixit has started selling genuine Xbox parts and offering repair guides, according to changes on its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/microsoft">Microsoft Repair Hub</a> spotted by <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://pnr.ouryahoo.com/story/engadget_us/e5fbf343-ad66-4d98-9594-8d64af18308e"><em>The Verge</em></a>. It now offers parts for Xbox Series S and X (digital and disk drive) models ranging from cases to power supplies to motherboards, along with toolkits, thermal paste and more.</p>
<p>iFixit announced its partnership with Microsoft in 2023 when it began offering official replacement parts for Microsoft Surface laptops. As part of that, it offered disassembly videos and step-by-step guides to help simplify relatively complex repairs.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s doing the same with Xbox, showing guides on replace motherboards for each console, detailing each step and providing a list of parts and tools required. Motherboard repair, for instance, requires 29 steps for installation along with additional steps to reassemble everything. However, so far, the company hasn&#39;t released any videos as it did for Surface devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>iFixit has similar agreements with other tech giants, offering replacement parts for <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-expands-its-ifixit-partnership-by-offering-parts-for-pixel-tablet-repairs-122600528.html">Google Pixel tablets</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/brave-pixel-fold-owners-can-try-to-repair-hardware-issues-with-ifixits-help-143528112.html">Google Pixel Fold devices.</a> If also works with accessory manufacturer Logitech, offering repair parts for two of its <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-joins-the-growing-list-of-companies-with-self-repair-programs-162537620.html">most popular mouse models.</a> The main holdout is Apple, though iFixit recently gave the iPhone 16 a <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/see-the-iphone-16s-game-changing-battery-removal-process-in-new-ifixit-teardown-213911136.html">decent repairability score</a> after dinging the previous model due to software-restricted &quot;parts pairing&quot; requirements.

        <title>The Spectrum review – a tactile trip to the 1980s</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>This latest piece of modern vintage hardware from Retro Games Ltd makes for an astonishingly nostalgic experience</p><p>The first time I played on a ZX Spectrum was at the Stockport branch of Debenhams, which in 1983 had an impressive home computer section that quickly turned into a sort of free creche for bored 13-year-old boys. You could hang out there for hours, typing rude Basic programs into an array of machines while the harried staff rushed about trying to stop them running. Some of the computers, however, ran games for customers to try – and this was where I encountered Manic Miner, the legendary platformer with its strange flashing visuals and surreal enemies. Speccy games looked utterly unique thanks to the machine’s idiosyncratic way of restricting 8x8 sprite maps to two colours, which meant moving objects on screen were usually collections of coloured pixel patchworks, leading to an effect known as attribute clash. Somehow, it was both ugly and beautiful – and it still is.</p><p>Unpacking The Spectrum, the latest piece of modern vintage hardware from Retro Games Ltd, is an astonishingly nostalgic experience. It looks exactly how I remember the original machine: a black slab with rubber keys, each one displaying not just a number or letter, but also a Basic programming command. “Rem”, “Rand”, “Gosub”, the mystical words of the home programming era. There is a USB cable to plug it in (though you’ll need a USB plug of your own) and an HDMI lead, but no joystick. The machine is compatible with most USB gamepads – you just need to configure the buttons yourself, which takes a little time but is worth it if you can’t bear using those rubber buttons to control your games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/dec/06/the-spectrum-review-a-tactile-trip-to-the-1980s">Continue reading...</a>]]></description>

        <title>Brazilian judge overturns ruling that forced Apple to open up its Store</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Brazil&#39;s antitrust regulator CADE <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/brazil-demands-apple-open-up-the-app-storeor-else-143016486.html">ordered Apple</a> to allow users to download apps and make purchases from outside its App Store, with a 20-day deadline and fines for not complying. Now, a Brazilian federal court has overturned that injunction, ruling that it was &quot;disproportionate and unnecessary,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/05/brazilian-court-apple-app-store/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cade ordered Apple to allow third-party developers to tell users about alternative ways to make in-app purchases (subscriptions, etc.) so developers wouldn&#39;t be forced to pay Apple a commission. It also demanded that Apple open up its ecosystem to other stores or allow sideloading. If Apple didn&#39;t comply within 20 days, it faced a fine of 250,000 Real (around $43,000) per day.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple appealed that ruling on the grounds that the changes would be too difficult to implement within that time frame and the court agreed. &quot;[The] technical complexity of the changes and the global regulatory impacts in similar decision in other regions, such as the European union, reinforce the need for such changes to be discussed in greater depth,&quot; a judge ruled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CADE began investigation following a complaint by local e-commerce company Mercado Libre, which accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior. The regulator can appeal the ruling and still force Apple to comply.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/brazilian-judge-overturns-ruling-that-forced-apple-to-open-up-its-store-130039766.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>The Morning After: Google DeepMind’s Genie 2 can generate interactive 3D worlds</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Google DeepMind has just revealed <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-genie-2-can-generate-interactive-3d-worlds-200708207.html">Genie 2</a>, a world-modelling AI capable of creating 3D worlds and sustaining those environments for significantly longer. Genie 2 isn’t a game engine. It’s a diffusion model that generates images as the player (either a human being or another AI agent) moves through the world the software is simulating. All it needs to start is a single image prompt either generated by AI or from a real-world photo.</p>
<p>There are limitations: DeepMind says the model can generate “consistent” worlds for up to 60 seconds, with the majority of the examples the company shared on Wednesday running for significantly less time — most videos are between 10 to 20 seconds long. Image quality also softens and comes undone the longer Genie 2 needs to maintain the illusion of a consistent world.</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is here. Sure, that’s not Harrison Ford, but Troy Baker’s impersonation is an excellent Indie, augmented by the writing, audio and direction, which makes it feel like classic Spielberg and Lucas fare. The game has a few rough edges, but it’s all unashamedly Indiana Jones.</p>

        <title>The best gaming monitors in 2024</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Let’s be honest: shopping for a gaming monitor can feel like wading through mud. As soon as you decide to buy a display for gaming instead of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-a-monitor-143000069.html">regular productivity use</a>, a whole host of new considerations come into the equation. Should you go for an LCD or OLED monitor? What about the differences between NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync? How about refresh rates?</p> 
<p>Those are just some of the questions this guide aims to answer. In the process, my hope is to help you find the perfect gaming monitor for your budget.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-gaming-monitors">How we test gaming monitors</h2> 
<p>While I’ve not used every product recommended in our list, I have extensively tested dozens of gaming monitors in the past, including models with WOLED and QD-OLED panels. In the case of the Alienware monitor I highlight above, I bought one for myself with my own money. Separately, I spent dozens of hours over a two-year period researching gaming monitors to write the current version of this guide.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-gaming-monitor">Factors to consider before buying a gaming monitor</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-lcd-vs-oled">LCD vs OLED</h3> 
<p>When shopping for a gaming monitor, you first need to decide if you want to go with a screen that has an LCD or OLED panel. For most people, that choice will come down to price; OLED gaming monitors are more expensive than their LCD counterparts. Even if money isn’t a concern, the choice might not be as straightforward as you think; both LCD and OLED panels come in a few different flavors, and knowing the differences between each type is important to making an informed decision.</p> 
<p>LCD monitors come in three different varieties: twisted nematic (TN), vertical alignment (VA) or in-plane switching (IPS). For the most part, you want to avoid TN monitors unless you’re strapped for cash or want a monitor with the fastest possible refresh rate. TN screens feature the worst viewing angles, contrast ratios and colors of the group.</p> 
<p>The differences between VA and IPS panels are more subtle. Historically, VA gaming monitors featured slower pixel response times than their TN and IPS counterparts, leading to unsightly image smearing. However, that’s improved in recent years. VA panels also frequently sport better contrast ratios than both TN and IPS screens. They’re not dramatically better than their IPS siblings on that front, but when contrast ratios aren’t an inherent strength of LCDs, every bit helps.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, IPS panels excel at color accuracy and many offer refresh rates and response times that are as fast as the fastest TN panels. The majority of LCD gaming monitors on the market today feature IPS panels, though you will frequently find VA screens on ultrawide monitors.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-about-oled">What about OLED?</h3> 
<p>If you can afford one, OLED screens make for the best gaming monitors. The ability of organic light-emitting diodes to produce true blacks is transformational. Simply put, every game looks better when there isn’t a backlight to wash out shadow detail. Plus, you can experience true HDR with an OLED screen, something that LCDs aren’t known for.</p> 
<p>Today, OLED screens come in two different flavors: WOLED and QD-OLED, with LG producing the former and Samsung the latter. I won’t bore you with the technical details of how the two panel types differ from one another other than to note both technologies broadly offer the same set of shortcomings.</p> 
<p>Most notably, OLED monitors don’t get very bright. At best, the most capable models peak at around 250 nits when measuring brightness across the entire screen. I didn’t find this to be an issue in my testing, but your experience may vary depending on the ambient light in your gaming room.</p> 
<p>If brightness is important to you, note that due to manufacturer tunings, different models can perform better than others, even if they feature the same panel from LG or Samsung. It’s worth comparing monitors in the same class to find the model that’s right for you.</p> 
<p>Separately, almost all OLEDs feature sub-pixel layouts that produce text fringing in Windows. The latest generation of OLED panels from both LG and Samsung are much better in this regard, to the point where modern OLEDs are good enough for reading and image editing. However, it’s still worth going to your local Micro Center or Best Buy to see the model you want in person, as the text fringing issue is hard to capture in photos and videos.</p> 
<p>Another (potentially more serious) issue is burn-in. Organic light-emitting diodes can get “stuck” if they display the same image for long periods of time. Every OLED gaming monitor you can buy today comes with features designed to prevent burn-in and other image retention issues. Provided you don’t use your new OLED monitor for eight hours of daily productivity work, I don’t think you need to worry about burn-in too much.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-screen-size-resolution-and-aspect-ratio">Screen size, resolution and aspect ratio</h3> 
<p>After deciding where you fall on the LCD vs OLED debate, you can start thinking about the size of your future gaming monitor. Personal preference and the limitations of your gaming space will play a big part here, but there are also a few technical considerations. You should think about size in conjunction with resolution and aspect ratio.</p> 
<p>A 1440p monitor has 78 percent more pixels than a 1080p screen, and a 4K display has more than twice as many pixels as a QHD panel. As the size of a monitor increases, pixel density decreases unless you also increase resolution. For that reason, there are sweet spots between size and resolution. For instance, I wouldn’t recommend buying an FHD monitor that is larger than 24 inches or a QHD one bigger than 27 inches. Conversely, text and interface elements on a 4K monitor can look tiny without scaling on panels smaller than 32 inches.</p> 
<p>You also need to consider the performance costs of running games at higher resolutions. The latest entry-level GPUs can comfortably run most modern games at 1080p and 60 frames per second. They can even render some competitive titles at 120 frames per second and higher — but push them to run those same games at 1440p and beyond, and you’re bound to run into problems. And as you’ll see in a moment, a consistently high frame rate is vital to getting the most out of the latest gaming monitors.</p> 
<p>If your budget allows for it, 1440p offers the best balance between visual clarity and gaming performance. As for 1080p and 4K, I would only consider the former if you’re on a tight budget or you exclusively play competitive shooters like <em>Valorant </em>and <em>Overwatch 2</em>. For most people, the user experience and productivity benefits of QHD far outweigh the performance gains you get from going with a lower resolution screen.</p> 
<p>Just a few years ago, 4K was not a viable resolution for PC gaming, but then NVIDIA came out with its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4090-announced-152529456.html">40 series GPUs</a>. With those video cards offering the company’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html">DLSS 3</a> frame generation technology, there’s a case to be made that the technology is finally there to play 4K games at a reasonable frame rate, particularly if you exclusively play big, AAA single-player games like <em>Alan Wake 2 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or enjoy strategy games like the Total War series. However, even with frame generation, you will need a GPU like the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-and-4080-super-review-183034039.html">$999 RTX 4080 Super</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-gpu-unholy-amounts-power-130020430.html">$1,599 RTX 4090</a> to drive a 4K display. Plus, 4K gaming monitors tend to cost more than their 1440p counterparts.</p> 
<p>If you want an ultrawide, note that not every game supports the 21:9 aspect ratio, and fewer still support 32:9. When shopping for a curved monitor, a lower Radius, or ‘R’ number, indicates a more aggressive curve. So, a 1000R monitor is more curved than an 1800R one.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-refresh-rates-and-response-times">Refresh rates and response times</h3> 
<p>And now, finally, for the fun stuff. The entire reason to buy a gaming monitor is for its ability to draw more images than a traditional PC display. As you shop for a new screen, you will see models advertising refresh rates like 120Hz, 240Hz and 360Hz. The higher the refresh rate of a monitor, the more times it can update the image it displays on screen every second, thereby producing a smoother moving image. When it comes to games like <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Valorant </em>and <em>League of Legends</em>, a faster refresh rate can give you a competitive edge, but even immersive single-player games can benefit.</p> 
<p>A monitor with a 360Hz refresh rate will look better in motion than one with a 240Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, but there are diminishing returns. At 60Hz, the image you see on your monitor is updated every 16.67ms. At 120Hz, 240Hz and 360Hz, the gap between new frames shortens to 8.33ms, 4.17ms and 2.78ms, respectively. Put another way, although a 360Hz monitor can display 50 percent more frames than a 240Hz screen in a given time period, you will only see a speedup of 1.14ms between frame intervals. And all that depends on your GPU’s ability to render a consistent 360 frames per second.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, a fast monitor will do you no good if you don't have a graphics card that can keep up. For example, with a 1440p 360Hz monitor, you realistically need a GPU like the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-a-1440p-powerhouse-for-599-160025855.html">RTX 4070 Super</a> or <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-and-4080-super-review-183034039.html">RTX 4080 Super</a> to saturate that display while playing competitive games like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and <em>Valorant</em>.</p> 
<p>There’s also more to motion clarity than refresh rates alone. Just as important are response times, or the amount of time it takes for pixels to transition from one color to another and then back again. Monitors with slow response times tend to produce smearing that is distracting no matter what kind of game you’re playing. Unfortunately, response times are also one of the more opaque aspects of picking the best gaming monitor for your needs.</p> 
<p>Many LCD monitor manufacturers claim their products feature 1ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response times, yet they don’t handle motion blur to the same standard. One of the reasons for that is that many companies tend to cherry-pick GtG results that make their monitors look better on paper. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) recently <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/vesa-clearmr-specifcation-announced-190731478.html">created a new certification program</a> to address that problem, but the grading system is unwieldy and, as far as I can tell, hasn’t had a lot of pickup from manufacturers.</p> 
<p>For now, your best bet is to turn to resources like <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.rtings.com/">Rtings</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/@monitorsunboxed">Monitors Unboxed</a> when shopping for a new gaming monitor. Both outlets conduct extensive testing of every screen they review and present their findings and recommendations in a way that’s easy to understand.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-freesync-vs-g-sync">FreeSync vs G-Sync</h3> 
<p>No matter how powerful your system, it will sometimes fail to maintain a consistent framerate. In fact, you should expect frame rate fluctuations when playing graphically-intensive games like <em>Alan Wake 2 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. For those moments, you want a gaming display with adaptive sync. Otherwise, you can run into screen tearing.</p> 
<p>Adaptive sync technologies come in a few flavors. The two you’re most likely to encounter are AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync, and each has its own set of performance tiers. With G-Sync, for instance, they are – from lowest to highest – G-Sync Compatible, G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate.</p> 
<p>The good news is that you don’t need to think too much about which adaptive sync technology a display supports. In the early days of the tech, it was rare to see a gaming monitor that offered both FreeSync and G-Sync since including the latter meant a manufacturer had to equip their display with a dedicated processor from NVIDIA. That <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-nvidia-freesync-g-sync-certification.html">changed in 2019</a> when the company introduced its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NVIDIA;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e46c965-eed3-42b9-a82e-44dfa49f76e7&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2dlZm9yY2UvcHJvZHVjdHMvZy1zeW5jLW1vbml0b3JzL3NwZWNzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmU0NmM5NjUtZWVkMy00MmI5LWE4MmUtNDRkZmE0OWY3NmU3Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2dlZm9yY2UvcHJvZHVjdHMvZy1zeW5jLW1vbml0b3JzL3NwZWNzLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVCZ-wRaib6o4qtd_qY8Z0BiaJKeRc5Aq1UCamVNVjJ1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fproducts%2Fg-sync-monitors%2Fspecs%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/">G-Sync Compatible certification</a>. In 2024, if a monitor supports FreeSync, it is almost certainly G-Sync Compatible, too, meaning you can enjoy tear-free gaming whether you’re using an AMD or NVIDIA GPU.</p> 
<p>In fact, I would go so far as to say you shouldn’t make your purchasing decision based on the level of adaptive sync performance a monitor offers. As of 2024, the list of G-Sync Ultimate-certified displays is about two dozen models long, and some are a few years old now.</p>

<h3 id="jump-link-inputs">Inputs</h3> 
<p>Almost every gaming display on the market right now comes with at least one DisplayPort 1.4 connection, and that’s the port you will want to use to connect your new monitor to your graphics card. If you own a <a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html">PS5 or Xbox Series X/S</a>, it’s also worth looking out for monitors that come with HDMI 2.1 ports, as those will allow you to get the most out of your current generation console.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-a-word-about-hdr">A word about HDR</h3> 
<p>As fast and responsive gaming monitors have become in recent years, there’s one area where progress has been frustratingly slow: HDR performance. The majority of gaming monitors currently on sale, including most high-end models, only meet VESA’s <a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://displayhdr.org/">DisplayHDR 400</a> certification. As someone who owned one such monitor, let me tell you it’s not even worth turning on HDR on those screens. You will only be disappointed.</p> 
<p>The good news is that things are getting better, albeit slowly. The release of <a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> did a lot to improve the state of HDR on PC, and more games are shipping with competent HDR modes, not just ones that increase the brightness of highlights. Thankfully, with more affordable mini-LED monitors, like our top pick, making their way to the market, HDR gaming is finally within reach of most PC gamers.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-gaming-monitor-faqs">Gaming monitor FAQs</h2> 
<h3 id="jump-link-are-curved-monitors-better-for-gaming">Are curved monitors better for gaming?</h3> 
<p>It depends on personal preference. Many manufacturers claim curved monitors offer a more immersive gaming experience due to the way the display wraps around your field of vision. However, I find the edge distortion distracting, particularly when you increase the field of view in a game.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-what-aspect-ratio-should-i-look-for-in-a-gaming-monitor">What aspect ratio should I look for in a gaming monitor?</h3> 
<p>The vast majority of 24-, 27- and 32-inch gaming monitors feature 16:9 aspect ratio panels, and that’s been the case for many years. In fact, nearly every game made in the last two decades supports 16:9 resolutions, such as 1,920 x 1,080 and 2,560 by 1,440, and if you buy a standard-sized monitor, you won’t need to worry about letterboxing.</p> 
<p>In the case of ultrawides, 21:9 is the most common aspect ratio, with some very wide models sporting 32:9 panels. Among games, support for 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions is far from universal, so don’t be surprised if a game doesn’t fill the entirety of your screen.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-is-oled-good-for-gaming">Is OLED good for gaming?</h3> 
<p>OLED monitors are great for gaming. Not only do they offer excellent motion clarity and input latency, but they’re also easily the best displays for HDR gaming. If money is no object, and you primarily use your PC for gaming, you can’t go wrong with an OLED monitor.</p> 
<h3 id="jump-link-how-much-does-a-good-gaming-monitor-cost">How much does a good gaming monitor cost?</h3> 
<p>While you could easily spend more than $1,000 to obtain the best gaming monitor on the market now, the reality is that the budget and midrange categories have never been more competitive. In 2015, I spent $500 CAD to buy a 1080p monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate and TN panel. The budget AOC model I highlight above is not only cheaper than my first gaming monitor, but it also features a faster 180Hz refresh rate and a higher contrast VA panel.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>How AI monitoring is cutting stillbirths and neonatal deaths in a clinic in Malawi</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>The only hospital in the country using foetal safety software has seen baby fatalities drop by 82% in three years</p><p>When Ellen Kaphamtengo felt a sharp pain in her lower abdomen, she thought she might be in labour. It was the ninth month of her first pregnancy and she wasn’t taking any chances. With the help of her mother, the 18-year-old climbed on to a motorcycle taxi and rushed to a hospital in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe, a 20-minute ride away.</p><p>At the Area 25 health centre, they told her it was a false alarm and took her to the maternity ward. But things escalated quickly when a routine ultrasound revealed that her baby was much smaller than expected for her pregnancy stage, which can cause asphyxia – a condition that limits blood flow and oxygen to the baby.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/06/how-ai-monitoring-is-cutting-stillbirths-and-neonatal-deaths-in-a-clinic-in-malawi">Continue reading...</a>]]></description>

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Colossal Order and Paradox’s sequel to its hit city construction experience got off to a very rocky start more than a year ago. Despite having a dedicated base of fans who provided a lot of insight into the development of <em>Cities: Skylines II</em>, the response to its release was far from positive.</p>
<p>Fans were upset that <em>Cities: Skyline II</em> only launched on PC instead of a simultaneous PC and console release. There was also criticism over the increased spec requirements a month before the game’s launch. Players with powerful PCs experienced problems with the game even months after the initial release. Colossal Order CEO <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-up-with-the-toxicity-around-cities-skylines-ii-213034938.html"><ins>Mariina Hallikainen</ins></a> wrote a blog post the following January describing a “growing tendency of toxicity in our community, something we have not experienced to this extent before.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/cities-skylines-ii-is-free-to-play-until-december-9-002023815.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review: Great movie, good game</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>has no business being as entertaining as it is. Outside of the superhero genre, there aren’t many high-quality licensed games out there, and this one comes with decades of film lore to live up to. And, frankly, it’s a little bit of a mess on Xbox Series S. Some of its scenes are stunning, but it’s also infested with resolution issues, mechanical glitches and silly animation bugs. In most other games, the combination of these problems would make me throw down the controller and uninstall.</p> 
<p>And yet, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is endlessly endearing. The game’s tone is pitch-perfect, it offers moments of earnest beauty and Troy Baker’s Harrison Ford impersonation is a treat to witness, let alone embody. In fact, every actor in the game is fabulous, and its writing, audio and direction feel like classic Spielberg and Lucas fare — but this time it’s all in first-person, interactive form, courtesy of Wolfenstein studio MachineGames.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<div id="7058d25523fd4188a66104e6bde96465">
 <div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sq97d1RkdRM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com"></iframe>
 </div>
</div> 
<p>I can’t speak highly enough of the writing in <em>The Great Circle</em>. Indy feels like an authentic extension of the film character, and his sassy remarks and dad-like frustration spill out in hilarious bursts throughout the game. His companion, Gina, is just as witty, mysterious and independent as Dr. Jones himself, expertly portrayed by actor Alessandra Mastronardi. The main bad boy, a Nazi archaeologist named Emmerich Voss (played by Marios Gavrilis), is supremely unsettling as he manipulates his troops and monologues at his captors, every word dripping with a dark sense of entitlement.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story is set in 1937 between the events of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and <em>The Last Crusade</em>, and it takes players to Rome, Giza, The Himalayas, Shanghai and the ancient kingdom of Sukhothai in north-central Thailand, on a quest to save the world from an old and powerful magic.</p> 
<p>Of course, it also involves punching lots of Nazis right in their stupid faces.</p>

</figure> 
<p>There are moments in <em>The Great Circle </em>where the music, environment, lighting and writing converge to create a memorable vignette, such as Indy’s first real conversation with Gina on a balcony in the Vatican. They banter back and forth as a Nazi airship docks on a domed turret behind them, afternoon sun glinting off gold roofs, and the music reacts to their strategizing and flirting with small trills. For a second, the game feels indistinguishable from a classic Indiana Jones movie, and it’s a real joy. There are a few cutscenes and gameplay bits that feel like this in <em>The Great Circle</em>, though there are just as many that look less polished on Series S, with stilted animations and too-harsh lighting. The writing and tone, however, is consistently top-notch.</p> 
<p>It almost feels like two studios made this game, and one of them was much better at taking advantage of the Xbox Series S hardware. The visual disparity is odd, with animation and resolution quality shifting from scene to scene. In between gorgeous set pieces, there are sequences that look like a remake of a game from the Xbox 360 era. It’s strange. However, I imagine playing on Xbox Series X or a capable PC would boost the resolution and stability nicely.</p> 
<p>Mechanically, the game is also hit-or-miss. Combat relies mainly on hand-to-hand fights, and while there are guns, they’re generally not the strongest weapon at Indy’s disposal. His whip is useful for stunning, creating distance and pulling enemies closer for a punch, and he’s able to pick up items like shovels, candlesticks, bottles and batons to use as projectiles or melee weapons. Random one-on-one fights against Nazis and fascists play out fine, with solid-sounding punches and sharp whip cracks, but the scripted melee battles tend to feel stagnant. Enemies don’t have a health bar and there’s little indication of how much damage Indy is inflicting at any given time. Dodging is a key element in these fights and it’s not the most responsive or forgiving system; inputs feel laggy or ineffective at times, and enemies are allowed to power up big hits even while they’re being punched.</p>

<p>Combat might be sluggish, but I had a great time playing <em>The Great Circle</em> as a stealth experience, crouching to sneak past Nazis and fascist guards like a fedora-wearing ghost. Stealth is a valid option in basically every scenario and it’s a simple, effective mechanic. Stay out of enemies’ sight lines, don’t shine lights in their direction and stay crouched, and you’re good to go. There’s usually enough time to adjust your position if you’re spotted, and guards are quick to move on once you’re properly hidden again. I truly enjoyed mapping out sneaky attack routes and then weaving between guards, throwing bottles every now and then as distractions. It’s kind of absurd when Gina tags along in these missions because she’s so, so awful at being stealthy, but the game never punishes you for the NPC’s missteps. Just enjoy the ridiculousness of your extremely obvious companion and keep slinking along.</p> 
<p>Puzzles are a major component of the game and they’re perfectly adequate. None of them stand out as being particularly challenging or innovative, but they’re built on clever ideas and executed well. There are light-reflecting puzzles, matching games, spatial-awareness tests and simple logic riddles, and they’re always finished with a cool item or a dramatic reveal. I may have missed some more advanced puzzles in the sidequests, and now that I’ve finished the main line I’m tempted to go back in and see what I missed, which is surely a sign of a successful game.</p>

<p>Exploration is <em>The Great Circle</em>’s most critical mechanic and thankfully, it feels great. Indy can climb and swing across gaps using his whip, and there are plenty of ledges, boulders, ladders and scaffolding to scale. Secrets, side missions and rewards are secreted around the maps, and curiosity is richly rewarded at every turn. Missions take Indy and Gina to snowy mountain peaks and down to murky, monster-filled waters, and there are moments of real terror and true beauty to be found. The game’s world feels alive, and it makes great use of vertical space. If you ever feel stuck in an area, just look up — that is, if you can.</p> 
<p>I encountered one game-breaking bug in <em>The Great Circle</em>. I was about 80 percent through the story, and I boarded a boat in the gunner seat as enemies raced us down the river and shot at us from the shores. I was unable to move the camera up and down, but I figured this was a weird restriction of the gunner mechanic. However, it persisted even after I stepped off the boat and entered the following scenes. I was unable to see climbing opportunities, never mind the problems with combat, sneaking and interacting. I tried restarting the game and the console to no avail, and I finally had to restore an old save and replay about 30 minutes of content. This worked, but the experience made me feel slightly crazy and a little sad (so, not too different from my baseline).</p> 
<figure>

<p>The feelings of unease didn’t last long, because I soon found myself trading punches and insults with a Nazi karate master in the middle of a raucous thunderstorm — you know, Indiana Jones shit. This was the cadence of my playthrough: Moments of satisfying climbing, puzzle and stealth gameplay interrupted by supremely silly glitches. What makes these bugs funny, rather than frustrating, is the game’s tone, writing and acting. With <em>The Great Circle</em>, MachineGames leans into the easy charm of Indiana Jones, highlighting his snark and the wild, unbelievable scenarios expected in popcorn action flicks.</p> 
<p>This game would make a great movie.</p> 
<p>And maybe that’s the thing about <em>The Great Circle</em>. MachineGames made a fabulous, classic-feeling Indiana Jones film, but they could’ve polished the game aspects a little more. So, set your expectations accordingly. Roll with the bugs, soak up the narrative, find all the secrets, and take a moment to laugh at Gina’s ludicrous running animation when she’s dressed as a nun.</p>

        <title>California will require fingerprint screening for Uber drivers to provide rideshares to minors</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>California is introducing new requirements aimed at protecting young passengers traveling alone in taxis and rideshares.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Nightdive Studios, the developer behind remasters of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-dark-forces-and-turok-3-to-be-remastered-by-nightdive-studios-114002864.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-dark-forces-and-turok-3-to-be-remastered-by-nightdive-studios-114002864.html"><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em></a> and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-a-first-look-at-system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-163311981.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/heres-a-first-look-at-system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-163311981.html"><em>System Shock 2</em></a>, have surprise-launched a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1864784023903760435" data-original-link="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1864784023903760435">remaster of 2002 cult-hit The Thing</a>. The upgraded game is available now for PC, Xbox One and Series X/S, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, and to stream through NVIDIA GeForce Now.</p>
<p>Originally developed by Computer Artworks, <em>The Thing </em>is a third-person shooter that acts a direct sequel to John Carpenter’s 1984 film <em>The Thing</em>, following a United States Special Forces team that’s sent into the film’s arctic base to investigate what happened there. Outside the source material, the game is best known for its trust, fear, and infection systems. How you play can impact whether in-game characters trust you, think you’re The Thing or turn into The Thing themselves.</p>

<p>With <em>The Thing Remastered</em>, Nightdive is carrying over the original’s core mechanics and updating the visuals and engine to run on modern consoles. Now you can play in 4K at up to 120 fps, with improved “character models, textures, and animations,” according to Nightdive’s announcement, and “advanced 3D rendering for updated lighting and atmospheric effects.” The game also includes trophies and achievements on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, if you’re looking for that, too.</p>

        <title>NASA delays Artemis II moon mission to April 2026</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>NASA announced a new schedule for its upcoming Artemis missions to send astronauts to the moon. This is the second delay to these crewed missions after NASA's <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-delays-its-first-crewed-artemis-mission-until-september-2025-195019383.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-delays-its-first-crewed-artemis-mission-until-september-2025-195019383.html"><ins>postponed</ins></a> the timeline in January of this year. The agency <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-shares-orion-heat-shield-findings-updates-artemis-moon-missions/" data-original-link="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-shares-orion-heat-shield-findings-updates-artemis-moon-missions/">said</a> it now aims to launch the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, as well as pushing back the Artemis 3 mission to mid-2027.</p>
<p>The delay was partly caused by issues with the Orion spacecraft's heat shield during the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight. During that mission, charred material on the heat shield wore away in an unexpected manner. Data from inside the capsule showed that if crew had been present during that flight, the temperatures would still have been safe even though the heat shield performed differently to expectations. But that's the sort of thing you don't want to take chances with once astronauts are aboard.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Victor, Christina, Jeremy and I have been following every aspect of this decision and we are thankful for the openness of NASA to weigh all options and make decisions in the best interest of human spaceflight," said Reid Wiseman, the NASA astronaut who will head the Artemis II mission. "We are excited to fly Artemis 2 and continue paving the way for sustained human exploration of the Moon and Mars." The other three Artemis 2 crew members are Victor Glover and Christina Koch of NASA and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
<p>The Artemis 2 is slated to be a ten-day mission around the moon and back to Earth. Although the team won't land on our most familiar satellite, the test flight is intended to collect more data about the Orion space capsule ahead of the Artemis 3 mission, where a team will touch down on the moon's south pole.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-artemis-ii-moon-mission-to-april-2026-224108612.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>New trailer for Revenge of the Savage Planet crash lands on YouTube</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>What happens when you combine the satiric spirit of filmmaker Mel Brooks and cram into a parody of the galaxy exploring <em>No Man’s Sky</em>? You get something like <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-journey-to-the-savage-planet-review.html"><em><ins>Journey to the Savage Planet</ins></em></a>, a funny, world conquering blaster fest that proves Ian Malcolm’s chaos theory of colonization while also providing a healthy dose of good, ol’ fashioned fart jokes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game’s original studio Typhoon Studios got swallowed up and spat out when Google closed down its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-game-studios-shut-down-montreal-los-angeles-201811811.html"><ins>Stadia Games and Entertainment</ins></a> division and all of its studios in 2019. Fortunately for us, some of those developers got back together, formed a new outfit called Raccoon Logic, raised some investment money from Tencent and took back the rights to their game for a brand new adventure.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A sequel called <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> is on its way to PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 in May of next year and a trailer just popped up during the PC Gaming Show.</p>
<div id="fb9a47d62d3a46f2a43f60ed2ee75286"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WQ8EEDycDk?si=1EVI7DvN5H4hYC_R" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet </em>appears to be sticking to its roots as a comedy adventure game about ruthless corporations battling the forces of nature across the galaxy for more territory it can call its own. The trailer features the return of Martin Tweed, the ruthless CEO of Kindred Technologies. There’s also a new FMV character in the trailer called Gunther Harrison, another ruthless CEO from a rival corporation called Alta Interglobal, who looks like a cross between Megamind and Morbo from <em>Futurama.</em></p>
<p>The new game can be played in solo or co-op mode. There are chances to uncover secrets, battle alien beasts and build your own colony on these worlds. There’s also a lot of flying slime, silly violence and savage attacks on corporate colonization thrown into the mix. If that’s what you liked about the first version, then it looks like there’s plenty more where that came from with <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/new-trailer-for-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-crash-lands-on-youtube-221409561.html?src=rss]]></description>

<p>Digital licenses can be added to Apple and Google’s apps now by scanning the front and back of your physical ID, capturing a scan of your face and submitting your digital application to be verified. Once added, digital IDs can be pulled up and used in the same way you’d pay with a digital payment card. Google has published a video on how to add your card to Google Wallet and Apple has a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111803" data-original-link="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111803"><ins>detailed support article</ins></a> on how to add IDs to Apple Wallet, if you’re looking for tips.</p>

The rollout of digital IDs continues to be a complex process, with the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tsa.gov/digital-id/participating-states" data-original-link="https://www.tsa.gov/digital-id/participating-states"><ins>TSA listing</ins></a> 12 states currently offering some form of digital identification, but only Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, and New Mexico currently offering IDs for both Google and Apple’s apps. To make things more confusing, some states like Ohio, Hawaii, and Iowa offer IDs for Apple Wallet but not Google's app.</p>
<p>The shift to an exclusively digital wallet isn’t without potential risks, as well. The American Civil Liberties Union <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/state-legislatures-need-to-block-creation-of-nightmarish-national-identity-system" data-original-link="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/state-legislatures-need-to-block-creation-of-nightmarish-national-identity-system"><ins>has criticized states</ins></a>’ quick adoption of digital driver’s licenses without putting in place additional protections for cardholders. Those include things like preventing ID issuers and verifiers from tracking the usage of digital cards and preserving the right to not use a digital card for anyone who doesn’t own or can’t afford a smartphone. Apple and Google’s solutions offer privacy protections in terms of encrypting information and keeping your device locked even after you’ve presented your ID, but they don’t totally account for how state or federal governments could access these new digital systems.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/new-mexico-state-ids-can-now-be-added-to-digital-wallets-211549853.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>PUBG creator Brendan Greene just announced a handful of new games</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Brendan Greene is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-playerunknown-leaves-pubg.html">largely credited with making the iconic</a> <em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>, also known as <em>PUBG</em>, and inventing the entire battle royale genre. We knew he left PUBG’s publisher <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pubg-creator-brendan-greene-new-studio-krafton-183054276.html">to form an independent studio</a> back in 2021, but now we know what he’s been working on the past few years.</p>
<p>His studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, is prepping a handful of titles, which it refers to as “an ambitious three-game plan.” First up, there’s <em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em>, which is described as “a single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre.” It uses the developer’s “in-house machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology” to create “millions of maps.” These maps are also easy on the eyes, as seen below.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/02f84eb0-b0c8-11ef-89fd-3a099bba7617" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/02f84eb0-b0c8-11ef-89fd-3a099bba7617" style="height:1394px;width:2488px;" alt="A screenshot showing a forested area." data-uuid="0fbd145d-d00e-390d-9d7e-4d17834376eb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">PlayerUnknown Productions</div></figure>
<p>We don’t know much about the gameplay, beyond the description and the aforementioned terrain generation technology. However, it’s available <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">to wishlist right now on Steam</a>. The company says it’ll launch as an early access title sometime in the first half of next year, following a series of playtests.</p>
<p>There’s also a nifty-looking tech demo <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">called Preface: Undiscovered World</a>. It’s free and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://preface.pp.studio/">available to download right now</a>. This demo is being released to showcase the company’s in-house game engine, called Melba. <em>Preface</em> allows players to explore an “Earth-scale world generated in real-time.”</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/b67b0cc0-b0c8-11ef-9f2f-28372ac54886" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/b67b0cc0-b0c8-11ef-9f2f-28372ac54886" style="height:952px;width:1698px;" alt="A desert area." data-uuid="4dad9aab-e863-3d84-9347-8eea6b12c637"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">PlayerUnknown Productions </div></figure>
<p>Greene says that this “digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback, contributes to its future development.” To that end, the Melba engine will be used to develop other games in the future.</p>
<div id="9b9cd0b3870d4e70b3714555a52bfc5e"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvK-bQwd03g?si=Wdv7OvphApVBi9nm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>One such future game is called <em>Artemis</em>, which is described as a “massive multiplayer sandbox experience.” We don’t know a whole lot about the title, except that it’s likely years away. Greene says that his company <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/">will be releasing two unannounced games</a> after <em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em> that will each address “critical technical challenges” that will help with the development of the more ambitious <em>Artemis</em>. In any event, it looks like PlayerUnknown Productions is certainly off to a promising start.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/pubg-creator-brendan-greene-just-announced-a-handful-of-new-games-210053256.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Waymo announces it's expanding to Miami</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Get ready to have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwBS6QGsH_4">that Will Smith song</a> stuck in your head for the rest of the day because the autonomous taxi company Waymo is going to Miami. Yeah, sorry about that.</p>
<p>Waymo announced its plans to Miami on its <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://waymo.com/blog/2024/12/next-stop-miami/">official Waypoint blog</a><em>. </em>The expansion will start early next year as the company gets its fleet of self-driving Jaguar I-PACE EVs familiar with Miami’s streets and intersections. Then in 2026, Waymo plans to start offering rides to customers through the Waymo One app.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Waymo is also partnering with the African startup Moove as part of its expansion plans. Moove provides vehicles for ride-sharing services.

        <title>Threads is testing post analytics</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Threads’ latest test could help creators and others understand more about how their posts are performing on the platform. The company is testing an expanded version of its analytics feature, which will show users stats for specific posts, Adam Mosseri said in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DDNNKv2y3Pz" data-original-link="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DDNNKv2y3Pz">an update</a>.</p>
<p>Up to now, Threads has had an “insights” feature, but it showed aggregated stats for all posts, so it was hard to discern which posts were performing well. Now, insights will be able to surface detailed metrics around specific posts, including views and interactions. It will also break down performance among followers and non-followers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Now that your posts will be shown to more people who follow you, it’s especially important to understand what’s resonating with your existing audience,” Mosseri wrote. Threads recently updated its highly criticized “for you” algorithm to surface more posts from accounts <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-will-prioritize-accounts-you-follow-instead-of-randos-191529420.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-will-prioritize-accounts-you-follow-instead-of-randos-191529420.html"><ins>you follow</ins></a>, rather than random unconnected accounts.</p>
<p>The change could also address criticism from creators on Threads, who have said they often <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/creators-getting-paid-to-post-on-threads-dont-understand-its-algorithm-either-065736099.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/creators-getting-paid-to-post-on-threads-dont-understand-its-algorithm-either-065736099.html"><ins>don’t understand</ins></a> how the app’s algorithm works.

        <title>Google DeepMind's Genie 2 can generate interactive 3D worlds</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>World models — AI algorithms capable of generating a simulated environment in real-time — represent one of the more impressive applications of machine learning. In the last year, there’s been a lot of movement in the field, and to that end, Google DeepMind announced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">Genie 2 on Wednesday</a>. Where its predecessor was limited to generating 2D worlds, the new model can create 3D ones and sustain them for significantly longer.</p>
<p>Genie 2 isn’t a game engine; instead, it’s a diffusion model that generates images as the player (either a human being or another AI agent) moves through the world the software is simulating. As it generates frames, Genie 2 can infer ideas about the environment, giving it the capability to model water, smoke and physics effects — though some of those interactions can be very gamey. The model is also not limited to rendering scenes from a third-person perspective, it can also handle first-person and isometric viewpoints. All it needs to start is a single image prompt, provided either by Google’s own <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-generative-ai-video-model-is-available-in-private-preview-160055983.html">Imagen 3 model</a> or a picture of something from the real world.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="dc85b25eb7a840cab09e396f1221ded2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Genie 2: our AI model that can create an endless variety of playable 3D worlds - all from a single image. 🖼️<br><br>These types of large-scale foundation world models could enable future agents to be trained and evaluated in an endless number of virtual environments. →… <a href="https://t.co/qHCT6jqb1W">pic.twitter.com/qHCT6jqb1W</a></p>— Google DeepMind (@GoogleDeepMind) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1864367798132039836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>Notably, Genie 2 can remember parts of a simulated scene even after they leave the player’s field of view and can accurately reconstruct those elements once they become visible again. That’s in contrast to other world models like <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.decart.ai/">Oasis</a>, which, at least in the version Decart showed to the public in October, had trouble remembering the layout of the <em>Minecraft</em> levels it was generating in real time.</p>
<p>However, there are even limitations to what Genie 2 can do in this regard. DeepMind says the model can generate “consistent” worlds for up to 60 seconds, with the majority of the examples the company shared on Wednesday running for significantly less time; in this case, most of the videos are about 10 to 20 seconds long. Moreover, artifacts are introduced and image quality softens the longer Genie 2 needs to maintain the illusion of a consistent world.</p>
<p>DeepMind didn’t detail how it trained Genie 2 other than to state it relied “on a large-scale video dataset.” Don’t expect DeepMind to release Genie 2 to the public anytime soon, either. For the moment, the company primarily sees the model as a tool for training and evaluating other AI agents, including its own <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-deepminds-new-ai-can-follow-commands-inside-3d-games-it-hasnt-seen-before-140341369.html">SIMA algorithm</a>,  and something artists and designers could use to prototype and try out ideas rapidly. In the future, DeepMind suggests world models like Genie 2 are likely to play an important part on the road to artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>“Training more general embodied agents has been traditionally bottlenecked by the availability of sufficiently rich and diverse training environments,” DeepMind said. “As we show, Genie 2 could enable future agents to be trained and evaluated in a limitless curriculum of novel worlds.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-genie-2-can-generate-interactive-3d-worlds-200708207.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Overwatch 2 will test 6v6 role queue matches starting December 17</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<div id="487b0a76a2044889aa3120475e3c28ac"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-NNPY96fIU?si=fJkUHhEQWxkVOT86" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>A new season <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24162755/" data-original-link="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24162755/"><ins>starts</ins></a> for <em>Overwatch 2</em> next week, but one of the special modes we'll be getting in the near future is a throwback to the past. For a limited time during season 14, there will be a 6v6 role queue mode, bringing back the original game's composition of two tanks, two damage and two support. This mode will be available from December 17 through January 6.</p>
<p>The switch to five players on a team when <em>Overwatch 2</em> launched was one of the more controversial choices at the time, we heard rumblings recently that Blizzard might walk back the decision. The current season included a full-on nostalgia trip mode where you could play 6v6 with only the original heroes as they were designed at launch. Yes, back in the days of self-healing Bastion mowing down everybody and Mercy undoing it all with full-team rez. The season 14 approach to 6v6 will be for the heroes as they exist now, with the current balance design in full effect. Blizzard said in October that they would <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-2s-long-awaited-6v6-tests-start-in-december-180100100.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-2s-long-awaited-6v6-tests-start-in-december-180100100.html"><ins>explore</ins></a> how the community felt about the increased team size and consider if six-player teams should have more of a presence in the live game based on the player reactions.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's the right time to experiment with different tank playstyles, because that's the role for the newest hero joining the game in season 14. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatchs-new-hero-is-hazard-the-spiky-scotsman-youve-been-waiting-for-175204343.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatchs-new-hero-is-hazard-the-spiky-scotsman-youve-been-waiting-for-175204343.html"><ins>Hazard</ins></a> is a spiky punk who deals a lot of damage at close range and can crowd control opponents by summoning a thorny wall. Think of him as a cross between Doomfist and Mei, with a Scottish accent.</p>
<div id="3bacf7a4d7f6408dad144572c6c0770e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender is coming to Overwatch 2! ⬇️✨<br><br>Join the fun when our latest collaboration arrives in-game on Dec 17 🤩 <a href="https://t.co/Z0HvK17NXv">pic.twitter.com/Z0HvK17NXv</a></p>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1864720158322794691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div> 
<p>The <em>Overwatch</em> X account also <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1864720158322794691" data-original-link="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1864720158322794691">teased</a> that the coming season will have another anime crossover. After collaborations with <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em>, the next season will be channeling the elements with skins themed on <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>. Omnic monk Zenyatta is clearly going to be reimagined as Aang, but the full lineup of cosmetics will also be unveiled on December 17.</p>

        <title>Forza Motorsport on PC is getting an enhanced lighting upgrade</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Gearheads, rejoice! <em>Forza Motorsport </em>for PC is getting a graphics update on Monday that adds a new realistic lighting system to the game. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:NVIDIA;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6ef34e37-5ae4-44d4-9693-58d5a5132851&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5udmlkaWEuY29tL2VuLXVzL2dlZm9yY2UvbmV3cy9kbHNzLTMtcmF5LXRyYWNpbmctaW5kaWFuYS1qb25lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWdyZWF0LWNpcmNsZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZlZjM0ZTM3LTVhZTQtNDRkNC05NjkzLTU4ZDVhNTEzMjg1MSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnZpZGlhLmNvbS9lbi11cy9nZWZvcmNlL25ld3MvZGxzcy0zLXJheS10cmFjaW5nLWluZGlhbmEtam9uZXMtYW5kLXRoZS1ncmVhdC1jaXJjbGUvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAY0jhAlv9S_lx3SnEt1e2ht5185Ri6f7ThU-IKbl5Zgv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss-3-ray-tracing-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-3-ray-tracing-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/">Nvidia</a> announced that Ray-Traced Global Illumination (RTGI) will be part of the PC-only upgrade for Turn 10’s driving simulator.</p>
<p>RTGI simulates how light interacts with surfaces in a virtual environment to create more realistic looking images. The upgrade for <em>Forza Motorsport</em> on PC will be able to create “more accurate indirect lighting and occlusion across tracks and cars in real-time, amping up visual fidelity and realism,” according to Nvidia’s post.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new RTGI lighting will be applied across all modes, cinematics and features in <em>Forza Motorsport </em>for PC. You’ll be able to take super sleek photos of your McLaren 720S Spider executing a perfect power slide in Photo Mode, marvel at your favorite cars in your Homespace and even watch enhanced cinematics with the new enhanced lighting system.</p>
<p>RTGI lighting must be turned on in settings in order to use it once the update is complete. Nvidia recommends setting “Raytracing Quality” to “Full Reflections + RTGI” and choosing a quality level under “RTGI Quality” to enable it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/forza-motorsport-on-pc-is-getting-an-enhanced-lighting-upgrade-191017416.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>OpenAI wants $200 a month for its most advanced features</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI kicked off its “<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-may-launch-sora-its-text-to-video-model-very-soon-171434280.html">12 Days of OpenAI</a>” series of livestreams with the announcement of a new, more expensive tier for its flagship chatbot. Starting today, ChatGPT users can pay $200 per month for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/">ChatGPT Pro</a>. Included in the package is unlimited access to the company’s latest model, o1, which following a <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-new-o1-model-is-slower-on-purpose-185711459.html">limited preview earlier in the year</a>, is now faster and 34 percent less likely to produce a major error when answering difficult real-world questions.</p>
<p>ChatGPT Pro also comes with access to GPT-4o, o1-mini and the company’s Advanced Voice mode, but the reason most power users are likely to splurge is the addition of an o1 “pro mode” that gives the chatbot additional compute power to reason through the most complex problems. “In evaluations from external expert testers, o1 pro mode produces more reliably accurate and comprehensive responses, especially in areas like data science, programming, and case law analysis,” OpenAI says of the feature.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p>
<div id="08d3a8be5a9d44ed9b23218760618fb3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OpenAI o1 is more concise in its thinking, resulting in faster response times than o1-preview.<br><br>Our testing shows that o1 outperforms o1-preview, reducing major errors on difficult real-world questions by 34%.</p>— OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1864735516455010475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
 

</div>
<p>In the future, OpenAI says it will add more “powerful, compute-intensive productivity features” to ChatGPT Pro, with some of those enhancements arriving as early as later this week and into next week as the company continues to show off what it’s been working on over the last 11 months. More broadly, ChatGPT users can expect support for web browsing and file uploads to arrive in the future, though during the company’s livestream, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman didn’t definitively say when those features would arrive.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, OpenAI will continue to offer its existing ChatGPT Pro subscription, which will continue to cost $20 per month and include early access to new features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-wants-200-a-month-for-its-most-advanced-features-191054506.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Foamstars’ next season will be its last</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>The fizzy, hot pink writing appears to be on the wall for <em>Foamstars</em>. Square Enix said on Thursday that the next season of <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enixs-splatoon-like-foamstars-will-debut-on-ps-plus-on-february-6-165837776.html">the 4x4 “party shooter”</a> will be its last. To be fair, all the game’s online services will remain available after the final season’s conclusion, and there will be events for those who hang around. But with development winding down (after <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/foamstars-is-going-free-to-play-starting-today-231750186.html">switching to a free-to-play model</a> in October), it’s hard to imagine the <em>Splatoon</em>-meets-<em>Fortnite</em> shooter will be long for this world.</p>
<p>The final season of <em>Foamstars</em>, the loudly capitalized “PARTY GOES ON!”, will <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" data-original-link="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update">run</a> from December 13 to January 17. You’ll be able to customize each character’s shots in the “concluding update” (never an encouraging phrase). After the final season is a wrap, Square Enix will bring back all season passes for you to switch between at any time. This will let you obtain all seasons’ items and rack up the full collection.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Foamstars</em> launched this past February <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/februarys-playstation-plus-games-include-foamstars-rollerdrome-and-steelrising-190919961.html">on PlayStation Plus</a>. The game has unique mechanics like spraying bright foam to build terrain, sliding on top of it and… dancing on a duck’s head to push it toward a finish line (as one does). However, after today’s announcement, the bright, loud and full-of-attitude shooter appears to be sliding toward a finish line of its own, with its development team presumably moving to other projects.</p>

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The stations offer rapid charging up to 900 volts and have CCS connectors that work with NACS vehicles that have an adapter. Rivian says support for native NACS connectors will become available later.</p>
<p>This isn't entirely an altruistic step, of course. Rivian sees it as a way to generate revenue from EV drivers who perhaps happen to be closer to one of its charging stations than any other. The chargers have a tap to pay option and the Rivian app isn't required.</p>
<p>Rivian plans to have more than 3,500 DC fast chargers in its Adventure Network.

        <title>EA just made a whole bunch of accessibility patents open-source</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>EA has just made 23 accessibility patents open-source, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/ea-makes-photosensitivity-and-speech-recognition-tech-patents-open-source"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Game Developer</ins></em></a><em>.</em> This means that other developers throughout the industry can use the technology at no cost. The news comes after <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-patents-pledge-accessibility-070041114.html"><ins>EA made a pledge back in 2021</ins></a> not to sue rival companies for co-opting these types of tools.</p>
<p>As of today, third parties <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge"><ins>can openly use a whole lot of patented tech</ins></a> to improve accessibility for users. This includes new speech recognition tools, simplified speech tech in games and the ability to create personalized speech detection algorithms. EA says other devs can use this technology to &quot;make it possible for those players’ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language and speaking style.&quot;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There’s also an internal plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that went into the open-source pile. This one incorporates EA’s photosensitivity analysis tech, called IRIS, and should allow developers to quickly catch potential problems that could impact players with certain health issues related to vision or the nervous system.</p>
<p>Kerry Hopkins, EA&#39;s SVP of global affairs, says this new group of open-source patents &quot;encourages the industry to work together to make video games more inclusive by removing unintended barriers to access.&quot; The company also says that this is just the beginning of its efforts to improve accessibility across the industry, as it&#39;s going to start running accessible design workshops and expanding its testing capabilities.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time EA has made some of its proprietary accessibility technology free for competitors. It has done so for the ping system originally found in the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apex-legends-100-million-players-193445914.html"><ins>battle royale hit </ins><em><ins>Apex Legends</ins></em></a>, which gives players a way to discuss in-game strategy without having to rely on voice chat. It also makes it easier to relay location data to teammates. The tech has popped up in other games like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-just-made-a-whole-bunch-of-accessibility-patents-open-source-181131893.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Meta expands its strike removal feature to Instagram and all Facebook users</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Meta is expanding its feature that helps users avoid “Facebook jail.” Earlier this year, the company began allowing Facebook creators to complete in-app “educational training” for first-time rule violations in order to avoid strikes on their accounts. Now, the company is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://transparency.meta.com/explaining-our-policies"><ins>expanding the feature</ins></a> to all Facebook users and opening it up to creators on Instagram.</p>
<p>As Engadget noted back <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-will-let-creators-remove-account-warnings-if-they-complete-educational-training-181503330.html"><ins>in August</ins></a>, the idea of the feature is a bit like going to traffic school. People who violate one of the company’s rules for the first time will have the option to complete a “a short educational program” in Facebook or Instagram’s app in order to avoid a “strike” on their account and any restrictions that may come with it.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users will be able to take advantage of the process once in a 12-month period for most first-time offenses. The process to “remove the warning” on an account will be available to anyone on Facebook, as well as creators on Instagram (a broader rollout for Instagram is expected “soon,” according to the company.) Meta won’t allow people to remove strikes for more “serious” offenses, including posts about sexual exploitation or drug sales.</p>
<p>Meta has described the strike-removal feature as part of its effort to reform its penalty system, which has long been frustrating and confusing for users who often get caught up in it unintentionally. In a blog post, Meta said that the in-app education features have already shown some signs of success with Facebook creators. “What we’ve already seen from our initial launch this summer has been promising — those who successfully removed their first strikes for violating a policy were more likely to say they understood Facebook’s policy decisions and became less likely to violate that policy again,” the company said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-expands-its-strike-removal-feature-to-instagram-and-all-facebook-users-170056830.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Microsoft starts testing Copilot Vision in Edge</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is rolling out a preview for one of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-copilot-ai-gets-a-voice-and-the-ability-to-see-websites-you-browse-140030003.html">experimental AI features it previewed</a> in October. Copilot Vision, which scans your web browsing and has a chat with you about it, is available for testing in Copilot Labs.</p>
<p>Copilot Vision has strict limits, at least at first. It only works in Microsoft Edge and only on “a select set of websites.” (The company says it will carefully expand that list over time.) Even the trial has restrictions: It’s only available to a limited number of <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-pro-is-a-20-monthly-subscription-for-advanced-ai-features-234847522.html">Copilot Pro ($20 monthly)</a> subscribers in the US. Like the available websites, Microsoft will expand access to more users over time.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft says Copilot Visions sessions are “opt-in and ephemeral,” so you’ll have to activate it manually, and each session’s data is wiped as soon as you’re done. The company says the feature only interprets text and images from browsed websites and doesn’t process content beyond that or train on web publishers’ data.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/a96e8130-b328-11ef-abf9-dd8982bd1ab9" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/a96e8130-b328-11ef-abf9-dd8982bd1ab9" style="height:1080px;width:1920px;" alt="Demo of Copilot Vision, showing overlaid chat bubbles on top of an image of a swanky loft." data-uuid="2879ec41-8299-31cd-8bfb-27653f8c0962"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cautious approach seems to be a course correction from the company’s sloppy Recall launch. That <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/with-recall-microsoft-is-using-ai-to-fix-windows-eternally-broken-search-172510698.html">“photographic memory” feature</a>, which snaps screenshots of everything you do on your PC, drew the ire of security and privacy experts, who called our Microsoft for — in a baffling decision — leaving the feature’s data unencrypted. It’s finally <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/heres-your-first-chance-to-try-microsofts-recall-feature-on-copilot-pcs-180536504.html">available for Windows Insiders</a> to try <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsofts-recall-ai-tool-for-copilot-pcs-faces-a-third-delay-191301031.html">after three delays</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-explains-how-its-tackling-security-and-privacy-for-recall-170059383.html">security adjustments</a>.</p>

        <title>Android's latest round of AI features improve accessibility, file sharing and more</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>If you’re an Android user, today is your lucky day; Google has announced a swath of new AI features for the entire ecosystem. Broadly speaking, the features make Android devices more accessible, but there’s something here for everyone.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the new enhancements, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-android-expressive-captions">Expressive Captions</a>, automatically generates subtitles that attempt to capture the emotion and intensity of what’s being said. So, let’s say you’re video chatting with a friend who groans after you make a lame dad joke. The feature will not only transcribe what they said, but it will also include “[groaning]” in the transcription. This works for other subtleties of human speech, too, such as when someone gasps or whispers something, and is compatible across Android, including streaming and social media apps. Per Google, Expressive Captions are available on Pixel 6 and newer Pixel phones, as well as “other compatible” Android devices.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Separately, Google has enhanced Android’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.android.com/new-features-on-android/?feature=gemini-for-lookout#gms-filter">Image Q&amp;A in Lookout</a> feature. The latest version of the tool makes use of the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model to provide more helpful image descriptions. Image Q&amp;A is primarily designed to assist blind and low-vision users, but in reality, anyone can use the feature to get Android to describe a picture in a natural-sounding voice.</p>
<p>Speaking of Gemini, Google is supercharging the AI agent with new extensions that provide better integration with some of the most popular Android apps. For instance, a new Spotify plugin allows Gemini to play your favorite songs for you and find playlists that suit your current mood. In the future, the company is promising tighter integration with Google Maps and even smart home devices that are linked to your Google account.</p>
<p>Additionally, Gemini now features the capability to remember things about you so that it can provide more personalized responses. For example, you can tell Gemini you’re a vegetarian, and the agent will remember that about you the next time you ask it to recommend a new dinner recipe. Google notes it has made it easy to view, edit and delete any personal information you’ve told Gemini to remember.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/7d9c5450-b31f-11ef-bafc-97449470426d" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/7d9c5450-b31f-11ef-bafc-97449470426d" style="height:1440px;width:2560px;" alt="Two screenshots showing Android&#39;s new auto-enhancement feature in Google Drive and QR code Quick Share functionality. " data-uuid="32fce553-47ac-3af8-8b69-07b9d9cd0246"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure>
<p>Another more practical update comes in the form of a Google Drive feature called auto-enhancements. The next time you upload a scanned document to the service, it will automatically edit the image to optimize the contrast and adjust the white balance, as well as remove any shadows and blurring.</p>
<p>And if you want to share a file with someone, Google has made that easier, too, with an improvement to Android’s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-will-force-apps-through-the-official-share-menu-082004255.html">Quick Share</a> functionality. There’s a new feature that allows you to transfer pictures, videos and documents by displaying a QR code on your phone. Using this tool, you don’t need to add the recipient as a contact or fiddle with your Quick Share settings.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you’re a Pixel user, you can look forward to all of the above features and more. Most notably, there are improvements to the Pixel Screenshots app. For one, now you can save things you find with <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-s24-and-pixel-8-owners-can-soon-search-for-anything-by-drawing-a-circle-around-it-180029757.html">Circle to Search</a> directly to the software. Google suggests this feature will be handy for holiday gift ideas. Pixel Screenshots will now also automatically categorize your snaps for you and provide suggestions, such as calendar invites and directions, based on the information you saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with most Android updates, it can take some time for Google to roll out all the new features it announced today to every user, so be patient if you don’t see them on your device right away.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/androids-latest-round-of-ai-features-improve-accessibility-file-sharing-and-more-170020518.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Samsung's One UI 7 is out in beta and it's chock full of security features</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Samsung’s One UI 7 operating system <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-one-ui-7-enhances-security-and-privacy-in-the-age-of-ai-giving-users-greater-transparency-and-choice"><ins>is finally out in the wild</ins></a>, albeit in a beta format. The updated UI focuses a lot of its improvements on security and privacy, which is never a bad thing in today’s world.</p>
<p>There’s further integration with the company’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-knox-matrix-10-years-of-samsung-knox-security-and-samsungs-vision-for-a-safer-future"><ins>Knox Matrix security protocol</ins></a>, which began popping up in <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-keynote-ces-2023-6-001836362.html"><ins>Samsung devices back in 2023</ins></a>. Knox Matrix continually monitors devices via a “secure private blockchain” and shows all connected gadgets on a dashboard.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This dashboard lets users instantly see the security status of various Samsung smart devices, including other Galaxy handsets, tablets, TVs and appliances. If a device shows as green in the dashboard, that means that it's “up to date and no risks are detected.” If something is at risk, Knox Matrix will provide actionable recommendations. All Samsung devices will <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/samsungs-one-ui-now-covers-all-of-its-consumer-devices-including-tvs-and-appliances-201850799.html"><ins>soon fall under the One UI umbrella</ins></a>, which should make this integration more seamless.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/cb55d810-b324-11ef-9abd-b2a73bcedf94" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/cb55d810-b324-11ef-9abd-b2a73bcedf94" style="height:1398px;width:2443px;" alt="The status page." data-uuid="cf9c7081-fcb2-3049-ab5a-131d51e77b43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure>
<p>There are also new security measures put in place for recovering data from the cloud. Enhanced Data Protection makes sure that all connected devices are synchronized and secure and helps users make a backup plan in the event of data loss. To that end, One UI 7 lets users sign in to a new device by verifying the credentials of their previous device.</p>
<p>One UI 7 lets people create and use passkeys to log into a Samsung account and gives users more control over network connections. To the latter point, folks can block 2G service, which is not that safe, and make it so phones won’t automatically connect to unknown networks.</p>
<p>Text messages and photos have even gotten a bit of tough love to improve security. Users can remove location data from photos and block hyperlinks from text messages. Shared photo albums can also be blocked, as can automatic attachment downloads. Users can block USB connections for an added security boost. The port will still work for charging, but not for anything else.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/6eea7b30-b324-11ef-bdff-971eab16575c" data-crop-orig-src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-12/6eea7b30-b324-11ef-bdff-971eab16575c" style="height:1396px;width:2482px;" alt="The USB block feature." data-uuid="37573c2d-e595-3036-acab-1066df747d33"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure>
<p>Finally, there's a new theft protection tool. Samsung devices could already be remote locked, but now there’s a feature called Identity Check. This opt-in software forces users to prove they are who they say they are if a PIN becomes compromised.</p>
<p>The new UI also brings a simplified design, broader availability of AI tools and a redesigned camera app. The full release will also include something called the Now Bar, which is a new notification system that Samsung promises will "transform the lock screen experience." It sounds a lot like Apple's Dynamic Island and Live Activities feature. Samsung's Now Bar isn't part of the beta, so we have to wait a bit longer to get our hands on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The One UI 7 beta program is available now for Galaxy S24 series devices in a bunch of different countries, including the US, Germany, India, South Korea and Poland. Users have to apply <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung Electronics;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c437fbb6-be8a-48ed-a933-826e128cabd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy9zdXBwb3J0L293bmVycy9hcHAvc2Ftc3VuZy1tZW1iZXJzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNDM3ZmJiNi1iZThhLTQ4ZWQtYTkzMy04MjZlMTI4Y2FiZDgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbXN1bmcuY29tL3VzL3N1cHBvcnQvb3duZXJzL2FwcC9zYW1zdW5nLW1lbWJlcnMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaSxWEHoNbFTc-imYiSoaR6HJXeuQWqQz5v9yUbqG-6R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fowners%2Fapp%2Fsamsung-members" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/samsung-members"><ins>via the Samsung Members program</ins></a>.

        <title>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is free on the Epic Games Store</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s Thursday, which means that Epic Games has a fresh pair of PC games on its storefront for folks to claim for free. One of this week&#39;s options is a humdinger. Until 11AM on December 12, you can snap up <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-release-date-crunch-151421921.html"><em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em></a> for exactly zero dollars.</p>
<p>This is easily the best Lego game I&#39;ve played, and probably the best Star Wars title. You don&#39;t have to start with <em>The Phantom Menace </em>if that name still causes you anguish 25 years later, though you&#39;ll play through the stories of all nine core Star Wars films. The game has that trademark Lego brand of silly humor with clever (and often very funny) riffs on famous moments from the movies. As you might imagine, <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga </em>is packed with Easter eggs. It looks terrific too. There are a lot of reasons why this was one of my favorite games of 2022.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em> is not perfect, though. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.polygon.com/features/22891555/lego-star-wars-the-skywalkersaga-has-led-to-extensive-crunch-at-tt-games">Reports</a> that developers at TT Games were pushed to work long hours to finish the game cast a dark shadow over it. In addition, the collectathon aspects may start to feel like a slog if you plan to reach 100 percent completion. Still, there&#39;s potentially dozens of hours of family fun here, and you&#39;ll be able to hop in gratis.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one other free title on the Epic Games Store this week in the form of <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/bus-simulator-21"><em>Bus Simulator 21 Next Stop</em></a>. I hope that&#39;s also a fun game for people who check it out, but I&#39;ll never know myself!</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-160712375.html?src=rss]]></description>

        <title>Oura is rolling out its sickness detection feature to Ring Gen 3 and Ring 4 users</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Oura is moving a respiratory sickness detection feature out of beta and rolling it out to Ring Gen 3 and <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ouras-fourth-generation-smart-ring-gets-smaller-and-smarter-070005477.html">Ring 4</a> wearers. Users with an active subscription should be able to take advantage of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=580d89c0-10cc-436e-92d8-ca1089066207&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL291cmFyaW5nLmNvbS9ibG9nL3N5bXB0b20tcmFkYXIvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ODBkODljMC0xMGNjLTQzNmUtOTJkOC1jYTEwODkwNjYyMDciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vb3VyYXJpbmcuY29tL2Jsb2cvc3ltcHRvbS1yYWRhci8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd0hNbcgO_LDPQWswjEZyDeLJAoiWJ_fr53R1LcbyTL2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fouraring.com%2Fblog%2Fsymptom-radar%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://ouraring.com/blog/symptom-radar/">Symptom Radar</a> by December 11.</p>
<p>Oura started publicly testing the feature earlier this year. The idea is that Symptom Radar looks at metrics including resting heart rate, skin temperature, sleep data and breathing rate to see if there are any differences from your baseline stats. If there are, Oura may let you know that it has detected possible common cold- or flu-like symptoms and offer suggestions on how to rest up and recover, such as putting your device into rest mode so you aren't prompted to meet activity goals.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following feedback from beta testers, Oura has added a couple of extra features to Symptom Radar. It now has a history graph showing wellness trends and whether the daily Symptom Radar result has been recorded (this should happen when a ring syncs with the Oura app each morning). There’s also a breakdown of each biometric input for those who want more granular detail on which markers have changed and by how much.</p>
<p>Like wellness detection features on other wearables, such as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/garmin-ecg-app-smartwatch-120035781.html">electrocardiogram readings</a> on smart watches, this isn't designed to make any kind of diagnosis. Instead, the aim is notify you of warning signs that a cold or flu may be about to hit so you can take action. Oura claims "Symptom Radar can detect signs of strain accurately and precisely, up to two days before a member selects an illness-related tag" in its tagging feature.</p>
<p>Symptom Radar <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=580d89c0-10cc-436e-92d8-ca1089066207&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL291cmFyaW5nLmNvbS9ibG9nL2luc2lkZS10aGUtcmluZy1zeW1wdG9tLXJhZGFyLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTgwZDg5YzAtMTBjYy00MzZlLTkyZDgtY2ExMDg5MDY2MjA3Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL291cmFyaW5nLmNvbS9ibG9nL2luc2lkZS10aGUtcmluZy1zeW1wdG9tLXJhZGFyLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbc1yngLHuc1tNZ3KGGlpYhy1JFyxb403jiu7lZYsufU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fouraring.com%2Fblog%2Finside-the-ring-symptom-radar%2F" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://ouraring.com/blog/inside-the-ring-symptom-radar/">stems from</a> Oura's work on COVID-19 detection, in which researchers found that the company's smart rings were able to predict symptoms of the virus <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/west-virginia-university-oura-ring-covid-19-symptoms-003239603.html">up to three days early</a> with 90 percent accuracy. That led into the creation of Oura's health management platform and then to a refined algorithm "based on a vastly increased data set, inclusive of millions of tags, that has significantly up-leveled accuracy to produce the new Symptom Radar feature."</p>
<p>While features such as Symptom Radar could be helpful in detecting respiratory sickness, it's still worth listening to your intuition and trusting your knowledge of your own body. After all, Shyamal Patel, Oura’s head of science, told <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313465/oura-symptom-radar-illness-wearable-smart-ring" data-original-link="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313465/oura-symptom-radar-illness-wearable-smart-ring"><em>The Verge</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that the algorithm isn't 100 percent accurate, and as such false positive and negative readings are possible. The company has yet to disclose accuracy data for Symptom Radar.</p>

        <title>Podcast picks of the week: Julia Davis turns agony aunt, the history of Grand Theft Auto and more</title>

        <title>The 8 best video doorbells tried and tested – and Ring isn’t top</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Whether you want to bolster your home’s security or simply make sure you know when someone is at the door, the latest generation of smart doorbells will help put your mind at ease</p><p>Doorbells have evolved.

        <title>PlayStation at 30: the console that made video games cool</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Launched in Japan in December 1994, the record-breaking PlayStation started out as a CD add-on for the Super Nintendo – but ended up ushering video games into a new era all on its own</p><p>If you were an obsessive video game fan in the summer of 1994, you’ll remember where you were when Edge magazine’s August issue dropped. By then, Sony had already announced its intention to develop the PlayStation console – the previous October – but it was the cover feature in the world’s most forward-looking game publication that really blew open the possibilities of the machine. As well as listing its specifications in full, Edge secured enthusiastic statements of support from Capcom, Namco and Konami. One breathless developer told the mag: “It’s going to revolutionise the way computers are at the moment.” Suddenly, the whole structure of the console games business was being threatened. All it needed was a push.</p><p>Sony’s entry into the video game industry has become the stuff of legend (and probably, one day, the stuff of a passable Netflix movie). In the late 1980s, the company was keen to get a foothold in an increasingly profitable business after the failure of its MSX games computer, so when the chance came up to build a CD-Rom drive for the soon-to-be-released Super Nintendo (SNES) console, Sony leapt at it. In the background, however, Sony’s engineering genius Ken Kutaragi, was also designing a standalone system, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/6/21168106/rare-nintendo-playstation-auction-sold-heritage">the PlayStation</a>, capable of playing SNES games as well as a new CD format that Sony itself would control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/dec/03/playstation-at-30-the-console-that-made-video-games-cool">Continue reading...</a>]]></description>

        <title>Am I too old to be a mobster? I played Mafia: Definitive Edition to find out | Dominik Diamond</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>I finally got to live out my gangster fantasies and found I fit right in with this bunch of jabronis</p><p>I am at that stage in life where my options are narrowing when it comes to the jobs I dreamed of doing as a child. I am too old to play football for Scotland, I will not own a brewery or become an astronaut. (In retrospect, aspiring to a job that combined all three was a tad ambitious.) It’s also risky to give up any job in this economy without knowing whether the new one will work out. Luckily, thanks to video games, I can try them out before taking the plunge. And you are never too old to be a gangster, are you? Which is why I started playing Mafia: Definitive Edition.</p><p>I did play it briefly in its original incarnation, 70bn years ago. Not for long, though, because it had driving sections as unintuitive and poorly controlled as that buggy on Mars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/nov/29/mafia-definitive-edition-dominik-diamond">Continue reading...</a>]]></description>

        <title>How Sony could reclaim handheld gaming from Nintendo and the smartphone</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s newsletter: A new PlayStation portable device that will play the PS back catalogue is reportedly in the offing – it could be a gamechanger for the market</p><p>• <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/nov/24/sign-up-for-pushing-buttons-keza-macdonalds-weekly-look-at-the-world-of-gaming">Don’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox?

As someone who still has a PlayStation Vita languishing in my desk drawer because I can’t quite bear to put it in the attic, this is an exciting prospect. It has been almost 13 years since Sony released the Vita, its last portable console, and it’s such a wonder of a thing, with its big crisp screen and dinky little sticks. I wish more people had made games for it – paper-craft adventure Tearaway and topsy-turvy platform-puzzler Gravity Rush remain underrated.</p><p>Actually, apart from the lovely and extremely niche <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/26/pushing-buttons-playdate-console">Playdate</a>, nobody has bothered to release a dedicated handheld games console in over a decade.

        <title>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl review – transfixing Ukrainian dystopia built on underlying tragedy</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>GSC Game World; PC, Xbox<br></strong>Explore the starkly beautiful landscapes of the irradiated Zone in this foreboding and remorselessly challenging survival adventure</p><p>When Ukrainian developer GSC Game World released the apocalyptic adventure Stalker in 2007, it was considered a bleakly improbable piece of speculative fiction. Heavily inspired by cult novel Roadside Picnic, it imagined an alternative timeline in which a scientific experiment in 2006 caused a second Chornobyl disaster and a vast irradiated zone filled with powerful space-time anomalies, in which the only inhabitants were mutants and the titular stalkers: men who wandered the wastelands looking for valuable artefacts.</p><p>The sequel, however, arrives in a very different world, its lengthy development period having been affected by both the Covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now the Stalker vision is a lot less improbable and its speculation has a much greater sense of urgency and authenticity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/nov/21/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-ukrainian-survival-adventure">Continue reading...</a>]]></description>

        <title>Apple Watch Series 10 review: thinner, lighter and basically the same</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Tenth generation Apple smartwatch gets a bigger screen and body overhaul, but blink and you might miss it</p><p>A larger screen and thinner body mark the biggest change to the Apple Watch in years, but you might have to squint to see it.</p><p>That is because Apple has kept much the same design on the outside despite requiring significant changes on the inside to make the watch thinner and lighter.

        <title>From Astro Bot to Balatro, the 2024 ‘game of the year’ race is too close to call</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s newsletter: The shortlist for December’s Game Awards is out, and the top contenders are neck and neck</p><p>• <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/nov/24/sign-up-for-pushing-buttons-keza-macdonalds-weekly-look-at-the-world-of-gaming">Don’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>Much like Christmas is a lot less enjoyable for the person who has to organise all the presents and cook the dinner, game-of-the-year season is rather intimidating for the people who have to put together the shortlists. Every November, I tot up all of the year’s acclaimed games I’ve yet to play, the underground recommendations I’ve yet to follow up on and the games I loved back in February but forgot about. I feel a mounting panic. And when all of the year-end lists come out, I inevitably find I’ve missed something anyway.</p><p>The Game Awards have just announced the nominations for this year’s ceremony, taking place on 12 December in Los Angeles. (Disclosure: the Guardian is one of 130 voting outlets for the awards, but my knowledge and involvement with them is limited to sending Geoff Keighley our ballots every year, usually a day or two late. Sorry, Geoff.) There are few surprises in the nominations, but I am pleased that one of the top two most nominated games is Astro Bot, with seven nominations, a game that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/sep/05/astro-bot-review-team-asobi-playstation-5-team-asobi-sony">cannot get enough praise</a> as far as I’m concerned. (The other is Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, up for six awards, which our critic dubbed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/22/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-a-miracle-of-fan-service">miracle of fan service</a>; alas, I remain immune to the charms of Final Fantasy despite many attempts over the years to get into it).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/nov/20/pushing-buttons-game-of-the-year">Continue reading...</a>]]></description>

        <title>Zoom CTO Xuedong "XD" Huang on How AI Revolutionizes Productivity - Ep. 235</title>
        <description>Zoom, a company that helped change the way people work during the COVID-19 pandemic, is continuing to reimagine the future of work by transforming itself into an AI-first communications and productivity platform. 

In this episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, Zoom CTO Xuedong (XD) Huang shares how the company is reshaping productivity with AI, including through its Zoom AI Companion 2.0, unveiled recently at the Zoomtopia conference. 

Designed to be a productivity partner, the AI companion is central to Zoom’s “federated AI” strategy, which focuses on integrating multiple large language models. 

Huang also introduces the concept of “AUI,” combining conversational AI and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to streamline collaboration and supercharge business performance.</description>

        <title>SonicJobs CEO Mikhil Raja on Using AI Agents to Connect the Internet, starting with Jobs - Ep. 233</title>
        <description>Companies in the US spend $15bn annually on talent acquisition. The most important metric in recruitment advertising is the conversion from the paid click on the job platform to the application the employer receives. Industry-wide, apply conversion is just 5%. Redirection of the candidate from the job platform to the company site is the biggest cause of abandonment; this step has a 70% bounce rate. In this episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz speaks with Mikhil Raja, Cofounder and CEO of SonicJobs, about how they have built AI Agents to enable candidates to complete applications directly on job platforms, without redirection, boosting completion rates to 26% from 5%. Raja delves deep into SonicJobs’ cutting-edge technology, which merges traditional AI with large language models (LLMs) to understand and interact with job application web flows. He also emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning foundational models to achieve more impactful and scalable innovations.

SonicJobs is a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday 24 April, the billionaire founder of the Telegram social media and messaging app, Pavel Durov, was arrested by French authorities as he disembarked from his private jet in Paris on his way from Azerbaijan.

        <title>DigitalPath's Ethan Higgins On Using AI to Fight Wildfires - Ep. 211</title>
        <description>DigitalPath is igniting change in the golden state — using computer vision, generative adversarial networks and a network of thousands of cameras to detect signs of fire in real time.  

In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravtiz spoke with DigitalPath system architect Ethan Higgins about the company’s role in the ALERTCalifornia initiative, a collaboration between California’s wildfire fighting agency CAL FIRE and the University of California, San Diego. 

DigitalPath built computer vision models to process images collected from network cameras — anywhere from eight to 16 million a day — intelligently identifying signs of fire like smoke.

“One of the things we realized early on, though, is that it’s not necessarily a problem about just detecting a fire in a picture,” Higgins said. “It’s a process of making a manageable amount of data to handle.”

That’s because, he explained, it’s unlikely that humans will be entirely out of the loop in the detection process for the foreseeable future. 

The company uses various AI algorithms to classify images based on whether they should be reviewed or acted upon — if so, an alert is sent out to a CAL FIRE command centers. 

There are some downsides to using computer vision to detect wildfires — namely, that extinguishing more fires means a greater buildup of natural fuel and the potential for larger wildfires in the long term. DigitalPath, along with UCSD, are exploring using high-resolution LIDAR data to identify where those fuels can be let out in the form of prescribed burns. 

Looking ahead, Higgins foresees the field tapping generative AI to accelerate new simulation tools — as well as using AI models to analyze the output of other models to doubly improve wildfire prediction and detection.

“AI is not perfect, but when you couple multiple models together, it can get really close,” he said.</description>

        <title>The Case for Generative AI in the Legal Field - Ep. 210</title>
        <description>Thomson Reuters, the global content and technology company, is transforming the legal industry with generative AI.

In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Thomson Reuters’ Chief Product Officer David Wong about its potential — and implications.

Many of Thomson Reuters offerings for the legal industry either address an information retrieval problem or help generate written content.

It has a AI-driven digital solution that enables law practitioners to search laws and cases intelligently within different jurisdictions. It also provides AI-powered tools that are set to be integrated with commonly used products like Microsoft 365 to automate the time-consuming processes of drafting and analyzing legal documents.


These technologies increase the productivity of legal professionals, enabling them to focus their time on higher value work. According to Wong, ultimately these tools also have the potential to help deliver better access to justice. 

To address ethical concerns, the company has created publicly available AI development guidelines, as well as privacy and data protection policies. And it’s participating in the drafting of ethical guidelines for the industries it serves. 

There’s still a wide range of reactions surrounding AI use in the legal field, from optimism about its potential to fears of job replacement. But Wong underscored that no matter what the outlook, “it is very likely that professionals that use AI are going to replace professionals that don’t use AI.” 

Looking ahead, Thomson Reuters aims to further integrate generative AI, as well as retrieval-augmented generation techniques into its flagship research products to help lawyers synthesize, read and respond to complicated technical and legal questions. Recently, Thomson Reuters acquired Casetext, which developed the first AI legal assistant, CoCounsel. In 2024 Thomson Reuters is building on this with the launch of an AI assistant that will be the interface across Thomson Reuters products with GenAI capabilities, including those in other fields such as tax and accounting.</description>

        <title>Wayve CEO Alex Kendall on Making a Splash in Autonomous Vehicles - Ep. 209</title>
        <description>A new era of autonomous vehicle technology, known as AV 2.0, has emerged, marked by large, unified AI models that can control multiple parts of the vehicle stack, from perception and planning to control. 

Wayve, a London-based autonomous driving technology company, and a member of NVIDIA's startup accelerator program, is leading the surf.

In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Katie Burke Washabaugh spoke with the company’s cofounder and CEO, Alex Kendall, about what AV 2.0 means for the future of self-driving cars. 

Unlike AV 1.0’s focus on perfecting a vehicle’s perception capabilities using multiple deep neural networks, AV 2.0 calls for comprehensive in-vehicle intelligence to drive decision-making in real-world, dynamic environments. 

Embodied AI — the concept of giving AI a physical interface to interact with the world — is the basis of this new AV wave. 

Kendall pointed out that it’s a “hardware/software problem — you need to consider these things separately,” even as they work together. For example, a vehicle can have the highest-quality sensors, but without the right software, the system can’t use them to execute the right decisions. 

Generative AI plays a key role, enabling synthetic data generation so AV makers can use a model’s previous experiences to create and simulate novel driving scenarios. 

It can “take crowds of pedestrians and snow and bring them together” to “create a snowy, crowded pedestrian scene” that the vehicle has never experienced before. 

According to Kendall, that will “play a huge role in both learning and validating the level of performance that we need to deploy these vehicles safely” — all while saving time and costs.

In June, Wayve unveiled GAIA-1, a generative world model for developing autonomous vehicles. 

The company also recently announced LINGO-1, an AI model that allows passengers to use natural language to enhance the learning and explainability of AI driving models. 

Looking ahead, the company hopes to scale and further develop its solutions, improving the safety of AVs to deliver value, build public trust and meet customer expectations. 

Kendall views embodied AI as playing a definitive role in the future of the AI landscape, pushing pioneers to “build better” and “build further” to achieve the “next big breakthroughs.”

        <title>NVIDIA’s Annamalai Chockalingam on the Rise of LLMs - Ep. 206</title>
        <description>Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are stirring change across industries — but according to NVIDIA Senior Product Manager of Developer Marketing Annamalai Chockalingam, “we’re still in the early innings.” 

In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Chockalingam about LLMs: what they are, their current state and their future potential.

LLMs are a “subset of the larger generative AI movement” that deals with language. They’re deep learning algorithms that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate language. 

AI has been around for a while, but according to Chockalingam, three key factors enabled LLMs. 

One is the availability of large-scale data sets to train models with. As more people used the internet, more data became available for use. The second is the development of computer infrastructure, which has become advanced enough to handle “mountains of data” in a “reasonable timeframe.” And the third is advancements in AI algorithms, allowing for non-sequential or parallel processing of large data pools. 

LLMs can do five things with language: generate, summarize, translate, instruct or chat. With a combination of “these modalities and actions, you can build applications” to solve any problem, Chockalingam said. 

Enterprises are tapping LLMs to “drive innovation,” “develop new customer experiences,” and gain a “competitive advantage.” They’re also exploring what safe deployment of those models looks like, aiming to achieve responsible development, trustworthiness and repeatability.

New techniques like retrieval augmented generation (RAG) could boost LLM development. RAG involves feeding models with up-to-date “data sources or third-party APIs” to achieve “more appropriate responses” — granting them current context so that they can “generate better” answers.

Chockalingam encourages those interested in LLMs to “get your hands dirty and get started” — whether that means using popular applications like ChatGPT or playing with pretrained models in the NVIDIA NGC catalog.

NVIDIA offers a full-stack computing platform for developers and enterprises experimenting with LLMs, with an ecosystem of over 4 million developers and 1,600 generative AI organizations. To learn more, register for LLM Developer Day on Nov. 17 to hear from NVIDIA experts about how best to develop applications.</description>

        <title>Afresh Co-Founder Nathan Fenner On How AI Can Help Grocers Manage Supply Chains - Ep. 208</title>
        <description>Talk about going after low-hanging fruit. Afresh is an AI startup that helps grocery stores and retailers reduce food waste by making supply chains more efficient. 

In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz spoke with the company’s cofounder and president, Nathan Fenner, about its mission, offerings and the greater challenge of eliminating food waste. 

Most supply chain and inventory management offerings targeting grocers and retailers are outdated. Fenner and his team noticed those solutions, built for the nonperishable side of the business, didn’t work as well on the fresh side — creating enormous amounts of food waste and causing billions in lost profits. 

The team first sought to solve the store-replenishment challenge by developing a platform to help grocers decide how much fresh produce to order to optimize costs while meeting demand. 

They created machine learning and AI models that could effectively use the data generated by fresh produce, which is messier than data generated by nonperishable goods because of factors like time to decay, greater demand fluctuation and unreliability caused by lack of barcodes, leading to incorrect scans at self-checkout registers. 

The result was a fully integrated, machine learning-based platform that helps grocers make informed decisions at each node of the operations process. 

The company also recently launched inventory management software that allows grocers to save time and increase data accuracy by intelligently tracking inventory. That information can be inputted back into the platform’s ordering solution, further refining the accuracy of inventory data. 

It’s all part of Afresh’s greater mission to tackle climate change.

“The most impactful thing we can do is reduce food waste to mitigate climate change,” Fenner said. “It’s really one of the key things that brought me into the business: I think I’ve always had a keen eye to work in the climate space. It’s really motivating for a lot of our team, and it’s a key part of our mission.”</description>

        <title>Co-Founder of Annalise.ai Aengus Tran on Using AI as a Spell Check for Health Checks - Ep. 207</title>
        <description>Clinician-led healthcare AI company Harrison.ai has built an AI system that serves as “spell checker” for radiologists — flagging critical findings to improve the speed and accuracy of radiology image analysis, reducing misdiagnoses.

In the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Harrison.ai CEO and cofounder Aengus Tran about the company’s mission to scale global healthcare capacity with autonomous AI systems. 

Harrison.ai’s initial product, annalise.ai, is an AI tool that automates radiology image analysis to enable faster, more accurate diagnoses. It can produce 124-130 different possible diagnoses and flag key findings to aid radiologists in their final diagnosis. Currently, annalise.ai works for chest X-rays and brain CT scans. 

While an AI designed for categorizing traffic lights, for example, doesn’t need perfection,  medical tools must be highly accurate — any oversight could be fatal. To overcome this challenge, annalise.ai was trained on millions of meticulously annotated images — some were annotated three to five times over before being used for training.

Harrison.ai is also developing Franklin.ai, a sibling AI tool aimed to accelerate and improve the accuracy of histopathology diagnosis — in which a clinician performs a biopsy and inspects the tissue for the presence of cancerous cells. Similarly to annalise.ai, Franklin.ai flags critical findings to assist pathologists in speeding and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses.

Ethical concerns about AI use are ever-rising, but for Tran, the concern is less about whether it’s ethical to use AI for medical diagnosis but “actually the converse: Is it ethical to not use AI for medical diagnosis,” especially if “humans using those AI systems simply pick up more misdiagnosis, pick up more cancer and conditions?” 

Tran also talked about the future of AI systems and suggested that the focus is dual: first, focus on improving preexisting systems and then think of new cutting-edge solutions. 

And for those looking to break into careers in AI and healthcare, Tran says that the “first step is to decide upfront what problems you’re willing to spend a huge part of your time solving first, before the AI part,” emphasizing that the “first thing is actually to fall in love with some problem.”</description>

        <title>NVIDIA’s Jim Fan Delves Into Large Language Models and Their Industry Impact - Ep. 204</title>
        <description>For NVIDIA Senior AI Scientist Jim Fan, the video game Minecraft served as the “perfect primordial soup” for his research on open-ended AI agents.

In the latest AI Podcast episode, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Fan on using large language models to create AI agents — specifically to create Voyager, an AI bot built with Chat GPT-4 that can autonomously play Minecraft.

AI agents are models that “can proactively take actions and then perceive the world, see the consequences of its actions, and then improve itself,” Fan said. Many current AI agents are programmed to achieve specific objectives, such as beating a game as quickly as possible or answering a question. They can work autonomously toward a particular output but lack a broader decision-making agency.

Fan wondered if it was possible to have a “truly open-ended agent that can be prompted by arbitrary natural language to do open-ended, even creative things.” 

But he needed a flexible playground in which to test that possibility. 
 
“And that’s why we found Minecraft to be almost a perfect primordial soup for open-ended agents to emerge, because it sets up the environment so well,” he said. Minecraft at its core, after all, doesn’t set a specific key objective for players other than to survive and freely explore the open world.

That became the springboard for Fan’s project, MineDojo, which eventually led to the creation of the AI bot Voyager. 

“Voyager leverages the power of Chat GPT-4 to write code in Javascript to execute in the game,” Fan explained. “GPT-4 then looks at the output, and if there’s an error from JavaScript or some feedback from the environment, GPT-4 does a self-reflection and tries to debug the code.”

The bot learns from its mistakes and stores the correctly implemented programs in a skill library for future use, allowing for “lifelong learning.” 

In-game, Voyager can autonomously explore for hours, adapting its decisions based on its environment and developing skills to combat monsters and find food when needed. 

“We see all these behaviors come from the Voyager setup, the skill library and also the coding mechanism,” Fan explained. “We did not preprogram any of these behaviors.” 

He then spoke more generally about the rise and trajectory of LLMs. He foresees strong applications in software, gaming and robotics and increasingly pressing conversations surrounding AI safety. 

Fan encourages those looking to get involved and work with LLMs to “just do something,” whether that means using online resources or experimenting with beginner-friendly, CPU-based AI models.</description>

        <title>Anima Anandkumar on Using Generative AI to Tackle Global Challenges - Ep. 203</title>
        <description>Generative AI-based models can not only learn and understand natural languages — they can learn the very language of nature itself, presenting new possibilities for scientific research.

Anima Anandkumar, Bren Professor at Caltech and senior director of AI research at NVIDIA, was recently invited to speak at the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. 

At the talk, Anandkumar says that generative AI was described as “an inflection point in our lives,” with discussions swirling around how to “harness it to benefit society and humanity through scientific applications.” 

On the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz spoke with Anandkumar on generative AI’s potential to make splashes in the scientific community. 

It can, for example, be fed DNA, RNA, viral and bacterial data to craft a model that understands the language of genomes. That model can help predict dangerous coronavirus variants to accelerate drug and vaccine research. 

Generative AI can also predict extreme weather events like hurricanes or heat waves. Even with an AI boost, trying to predict natural events is challenging because of the sheer number of variables and unknowns. 

However, Anandkumar explains that it’s not just a matter of upsizing language models or adding compute power — it’s also about fine-tuning and setting the right parameters.

“Those are the aspects we’re working on at NVIDIA and Caltech, in collaboration with many other organizations, to say, ‘How do we capture the multitude of scales present in the natural world?’” she said. “With the limited data we have, can we hope to extrapolate to finer scales? Can we hope to embed the right constraints and come up with physically valid predictions that make a big impact?” 

Anandkumar adds that to ensure AI models are responsibly and safely used, existing laws must be strengthened to prevent dangerous downstream applications.

She also talks about the AI boom, which is transforming the role of humans across industries, and problems yet to be solved. 

“This is the research advice I give to everyone: the most important thing is the question, not the answer,” she said.</description>

        <title>Deepdub’s Ofir Krakowski on Redefining Dubbing from Hollywood to Bollywood - Ep. 202</title>
        <description>In the global entertainment landscape, TV show and film production stretches far beyond Hollywood or Bollywood — it's a worldwide phenomenon. 

However, while streaming platforms have broadened the reach of content, dubbing and translation technology still has plenty of room for growth.

Deepdub acts as a digital bridge, providing access to content by using generative AI to break down language and cultural barriers.

On the latest episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz spoke with the Israel-based startup’s co-founder and CEO, Ofir Krakowski. Deepdub uses AI-driven dubbing to help entertainment companies boost efficiency and cut costs while increasing accessibility. 

The company is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that offers startups go-to-market support, expertise and technological assistance. 

Traditional dubbing is slow, costly and often missing the mark, Krakowski says. Current technology struggles with the subtleties of language, leaving jokes, idioms or jargon lost in translation. 

Deepdub offers a web-based platform that enables people to interact with sophisticated AI models to handle each part of the translation and dubbing process efficiently. It translates the text, generates a voice and mixes it into the original music and audio effects. 

But as Krakowkski points out, even the best AI models make mistakes, so the platform involves a human touchpoint to verify translations and ensure that generated voices sound natural and capture the right emotion. 

Deepdub is also working on matching lip movements to dubbed voices. 

Ultimately, Krakowski hopes to free the world from the restrictions placed by language barriers. 

“I believe that the technology will enable people to enjoy the content that is created around the world,” he said. “It will globalize storytelling and knowledge, which are currently bound by language barriers.”

        <title>Replit CEO Amjad Masad on Empowering the Next Billion Software Creators - Ep. 201</title>
        <description>Replit aims to empower the next billion software creators. 

In this week’s episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kraviz dives into a conversation with Replit CEO Amjad Masad. Masad says the San Francisco-based maker of a software development platform, which came up as a member of NVIDIA’s startup accelerator program, wants to bridge the gap between ideas and software, a task simplified by advances in generative AI. 

“Replit is fundamentally about reducing the friction between an idea and a software product,” Masad said. 

The company’s Ghostwriter coding AI has two main features: a code completion model and a chat model. These features not only make suggestions as users type their code, but also provide intelligent explanations of what a piece of code is doing, tracing dependencies and context. The model can even flag errors and offers solutions — like a full collaborator in a Google Docs for code. 

The company is also developing “make me an app” functionality. This tool allows users to provide high-level instructions to an Artificial Developer Intelligence, which then builds, tests and iterates the requested software. 

The aim is to make software creation accessible to all, even those with no coding experience. While this feature is still under development, Masad said the company plans to improve it over the next year, potentially having it ready for developers in the next 6 to 8 months. 

Going forward, Masad envisions a future where AI functions as a collaborator, able to conduct high-level tasks and even manage resources. “We're entering a period where software is going to feel more alive,” Masad said. “And so I think computing is becoming more humane, more accessible, more exciting, more natural.”

        <title>Glean Founders Talk AI-Powered Enterprise Search on NVIDIA Podcast - Ep. 190</title>
        <description>In the quest for knowledge at work, it can be tempting to think that finding what you need is like a needle in a haystack. But what if the haystack itself could show you where the needle is?

That's the promise of large language models, or LLMs as they’re known, and it's the subject of a this week’s episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast featuring Deedy Das and Eddie Zhou, founding engineers at Glean, in conversation with our host, Noah Kravitz.  

With large-language models, the haystack can become a source of intelligence, helping guide knowledge workers on what they need to know. 

Glean is a Silicon Valley startup focused on providing better tools for enterprise search by indexing everything employees have access to in the company, including Slack, Dropbox, and email. The company raised a Series C financing round last year, valuing the company at $1 billion. 

By indexing everything employees have access to in the company, LLMs can provide a comprehensive view of the enterprise and its data, making it easier to find the information needed to get work done. 

In the podcast, Das and Zhou discuss the challenges and opportunities of bringing LLMs into the enterprise, and how this technology can help people spend less time searching and more time working.

        <title>Hittin’ the Sim: NVIDIA’s Matt Cragun on Conditioning Autonomous Vehicles in Simulation - Ep. 185</title>
        <description>Training, testing and validating autonomous vehicles requires a continuous pipeline — or data factory — to introduce new scenarios and refine deep neural networks.

A key component of this process is simulation. AV developers can test a virtually limitless number of scenarios, repeatably and at scale, with high-fidelity, physically based simulation. And like much of the technology related to AI, simulation is constantly evolving and improving, getting ever nearer to closing the gap between the real and virtual worlds.

NVIDIA DRIVE Sim, built on Omniverse, provides a virtual proving ground for AV testing and validation. It’s a highly accurate simulation platform with the ability to enable groundbreaking tools, including synthetic data generation and neural reconstruction, to build digital twins of driving environments and scenarios.

Matt Cragun, senior product manager for AV simulation at NVIDIA, joined the AI Podcast to discuss the development of simulation for self-driving technology, detailing the origins and inner workings of DRIVE Sim.

He also provided a sneak peek into the frontiers researchers are exploring for this critical testing and validation technology.

        <title>AI-Equipped Drones Could Offer Real-Time Updates on Endangered African Black Rhinos - Ep. 182</title>
        <description>In the latest example of how researchers are using the latest technologies to track animals less invasively, a team of researchers has proposed harnessing high-flying AI-equipped drones powered to track the endangered black rhino through the wilds of Namibia.

In a paper published earlier this year in the journal PeerJ, the researchers show the potential of drone-based AI to identify animals in even the remotest areas and provide real-time updates on their status from the air.

While drones — and technology of just about every kind — have been harnessed to track African wildlife, the proposal promises to help gamekeepers move faster to protect rhinos and other megafauna from poachers.

AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz spoke to two of the authors of the paper. 

Zoey Jewel is co founder and president of wild track.org, a global network of biologists and conservationists dedicated to non invasive wildlife monitoring techniques. And Alice Hua is a recent graduate of the School of Information at UC Berkeley in California, and an ML platform engineer at CrowdStrike.

        <title>Researchers Use AI to Help Earbud Users Mute Background Noise - Ep. 180</title>
        <description>Thanks to earbuds, people can take calls anywhere, while doing anything. The problem: those on the other end of the call can hear all the background noise, too, whether it’s the roommate’s vacuum cleaner or neighboring conversations at a café.

Now, work by a trio of graduate students at the University of Washington, who spent the pandemic cooped up together in a noisy apartment, lets those on the other end of the call hear just the speaker — rather than all the surrounding sounds.

Users found that the system, dubbed “ClearBuds” — presented last month at the ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications and Services — improved background noise suppression much better than a commercially available alternative.

AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz caught up with the team at ClearBuds to discuss the unlikely pandemic-time origin story behind a technology that promises to make calls clearer and easier, wherever we go.</description>

        <title>Reinventing the Wheel: Gatik’s Apeksha Kumavat Accelerates Autonomous Delivery - Ep. 178</title>
        <description>As consumers expect faster, cheaper deliveries, companies are turning to AI to rethink how they move goods. 

Foremost among these new systems are “hub-and-spoke,” or middle-mile, operations, where companies place distribution centers closer to retail operations for quicker access to inventory. However, faster delivery is just part of the equation. These systems must also be low cost for consumers.

Autonomous delivery company Gatik seeks to provide lasting solutions for faster and cheaper shipping. By automating the routes between the hub — the distribution center — and the spokes — retail stores — these operations can run around the clock efficiently and with minimal investment.

Gatik co-founder and Chief Engineer Apeksha Kumavat joined NVIDIA’s Katie Burke Washabaugh on the latest episode of the AI Podcast to walk through how the company is developing autonomous trucks for middle-mile delivery.

        <title>What Is Conversational AI? ZeroShot Bot CEO Jason Mars Explains - Ep. 168</title>
        <description>Entrepreneur Jason Mars calls conversation our “first technology.” 

Before humans invented the wheel, crafted a spear or tamed fire, we mastered the superpower of talking to one another. 

That makes conversation an incredibly important tool. 

But if you’ve dealt with the automated chatbots deployed by the customer service arms of just about any big organization lately — whether banks or airlines — you also know how hard it can be to get it right. 

Deep learning AI and new techniques such as zero-shot learning promise to change that. 

On this episode of NVIDIA’s AI Podcast, host Noah Kravitz — whose intelligence is anything but artificial — spoke with Mars about how the latest AI techniques intersect with the very ancient art of conversation. 

In addition to being an entrepreneur and CEO of several startups, including Zero Shot Bot, Mars is an associate professor of computer science at the University of Michigan and the author of “Breaking Bots: Inventing a New Voice in the AI Revolution” (ForbesBooks, 2021).</description>

        <title>Exaggeration Detector Could Lead to More Accurate Health Science Journalism - Ep. 163</title>
        <description>It would be an exaggeration to say you’ll never again read a news article overhyping a medical breakthrough. But, thanks to researchers at the University of Copenhagen, spotting hyperbole may one day get more manageable.

In a paper, Dustin Wright and Isabelle Augenstein explain how they used NVIDIA GPUs to train an “exaggeration detection system” to identify overenthusiastic claims in health science reporting.

The paper comes amid a pandemic that has fueled demand for understandable, accurate information. And social media has made health misinformation more widespread.

Research like Wright and Augenstein’s could speed more precise health sciences news to more people. We spoke with Wright about his work.

        <title>Real or Not Real? Attorney Steven Frank Uses Deep Learning to Authenticate Art - Ep. 157</title>
        <description>Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Jesus, known as Salvator Mundi, was sold at a British auction for nearly half a billion dollars in 2017, making it the most expensive painting ever to change hands.

However, even art history experts were skeptical about whether the work was an original of the master rather than one of his many protégés. 

Steven Frank is a partner at the law firm Morgan Lewis, specializing in intellectual property and commercial technology law. He’s also half of the husband-wife team that used convolutional neural networks to determine that this painting was likely an authentic da Vinci.

He spoke with NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about working with his wife, Andrea Frank, a professional curator of art images, to authenticate artistic masterpieces with AI’s help.

        <title>GE's Danielle Merfeld and Arvind Rangarajan on AI and Renewable Energy - Ep. 150</title>
        <description>At GE Renewable Energy, CTO Danielle Merfeld and technical leader Arvind Rangarajan are among those making advances throughout renewable energy.

Merfeld and Rangarajan spoke with NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about how the company uses AI and a human-in-the-loop process to make renewable energy more widespread.

The International Energy Agency has set a goal to reach a net zero energy sector by 2050. To reach this goal, 88 percent of electricity needs to come from renewable sources.

Wind energy will account for 40 percent of that, but today only makes up 8 percent of renewable energy.

        <title>Jules Anh Tuan Nguyen Explains How AI Lets Amputee Control Prosthetic Hand, Video Games - Ep. 149</title>
        <description>Path-breaking work that translates an amputee’s thoughts into finger motions, and even commands in video games, holds open the possibility of humans controlling just about anything digital with their minds.

Using GPUs, a group of researchers trained an AI neural decoder able to run on a compact, power-efficient NVIDIA Jetson Nano system on module (SOM) to translate 46-year-old Shawn Findley’s thoughts into individual finger motions.

And if that breakthrough weren’t enough, the team then plugged Findley into a PC running Far Cry 5 and Raiden IV, where he had his game avatar move, jump — even fly a virtual helicopter — using his mind.

It’s a demonstration that not only promises to give amputees more natural and responsive control over their prosthetics. It could one day give users almost superhuman capabilities.

The effort is detailed in a draft paper, or pre-print, titled “A Portable, Self-Contained Neuroprosthetic Hand with Deep Learning-Based Finger Control.” It details an extraordinary cross-disciplinary collaboration behind a system that, in effect, allows humans to control just about anything digital with thoughts.

Jules Anh Tuan Nguyen,  the paper’s lead author and now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota, spoke with NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about his efforts to allow amputees to control their prosthetic limb — right down to the finger motions — with their minds.

        <title>Waste Not, Want Not: AI Startup Opseyes Revolutionizes Wastewater Analysis - Ep. 145</title>
        <description>What do radiology and wastewater have in common? Hopefully, not much. 

But at startup Opseyes, founder Bryan Arndt and data scientist Robin Schlenga are putting the AI that’s revolutionizing medical imaging to work on analyzing wastewater samples.

Arndt and Schlenga spoke with NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about the inspiration for Opseyes, which began with Arndt’s career at wastewater industry leader Ramboll. Effluent has typically been analyzed by sending tightly sealed samples through the mail to experts.

While speaking with his brother, a radiologist using deep learning, Arndt realized that AI could do something similar for wastewater samples.

Schlenga then led the creation of Opseyes’ convolutional neural network, which allows customers to upload a photo of a sample taken through a microscope. With Opseyes already in use at several wastewater plants, Arndt and Schlenga anticipate much more bacterial analysis in their future.

        <title>Getting Clever with Kaolin: Researchers Accelerate 3D Deep Learning with New Tools - Ep. 144</title>
        <description>3D deep learning holds the potential to accelerate progress in everything from robotics to medical imaging. But until now, researchers haven’t had the right tools to easily manage and visualize different types of 3D data.

NVIDIA Kaolin is a collection of tools within the NVIDIA Omniverse simulation and collaboration platform that allows researchers to visualize and generate datasets, move between 3D tools and retain basic functions for other users.

NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz spoke with four NVIDIANs about their work on the platform, including Richard Kerris, industry general manager for Omniverse; Jean-Francois Lafleche, a deep learning engineer; Senior Research Scientist Masha Shugrina; and Research Scientist Clement Fuji Tsang.

Kaolin includes both a library, which contains a growing number of GPU-optimized operations, and an app within NVIDIA Omniverse for interactive 3D data visualizations. The long-term goal is to make both facets so robust that users could import a photo that generates a highly developed 3D model without spending time on recreating the scene within a 3D platform.

        <title>NVIDIA’s Julie Bernauer Talks Setting Up One of World’s Fastest Supercomputers - Ep. 141</title>
        <description>Julie Bernauer — senior solutions architect for machine learning and deep learning at NVIDIA — led the small team that successfully built Selene, the world’s fifth-fastest supercomputer.

Adding to an already impressive feat, Bernauer’s team brought up Selene as the world went into lockdown in early 2020. They used skeleton crews, social distancing protocols, and remote cable validation to achieve what typically takes months with a larger install team in a few weeks.

Bernauer told NVIDIA AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about the goal in creating Selene, which was primarily to support NVIDIA’s researchers. Referencing her time as a doctoral student, Bernauer explains how researchers are often prevented from working on larger models due to expense and infrastructure.

With Selene, the infrastructure is modular and can be scaled up or down depending on what users require, and allows for different types of research to be performed simultaneously. Bernauer said that Selene is proving most useful to autonomous vehicle and language modeling research at the moment.

Going forward, Bernauer envisions some of the power and efficiency of systems like Selene becoming more available on widely accessible devices, such as laptops or edge products such as cars.</description>

        <title>Drum Roll, Please: AI Startup Sunhouse Founder Tlacael Esparza Finds His Rhythm - Ep. 139</title>
        <description>Drawing on his trifecta of degrees in math, music and music technology, Tlacael Esparza, co-founder and CTO of Sunhouse, is revolutionizing electronic drumming.

Esparza has created Sensory Percussion, a combination of hardware and software that uses sensors and AI to allow a single drum to produce a complex range of sounds depending on where and how the musician hits it.

In the latest installment of the NVIDIA AI Podcast, Esparza spoke with host Noah Kravitz about the tech behind the tool, and what inspired him to create Sunhouse. Esparza has been doing drumstick tricks of his own for many years — prior to founding Sunhouse, he toured with a variety of bands and recorded drums for many albums.

Esparza’s musical skill and programming knowledge formed the basis for Sensory Percussion. Partnering with his brother, Tenoch, and with support from a New York University startup accelerator, Sunhouse was born in 2014.

Since then, it’s become successful with live performers. Esparza is especially proud of its popularity in the New York jazz community and among drumming legends like Marcus Gilmore and Wilco’s Glenn Kotche.

        <title>Making Machines More Human: Best-Selling Author Brian Christian on the Alignment Problem - Ep. 135</title>
        <description>Not many can claim to be a computer programmer, nonfiction author and poet, but Brian Christian has established himself as all three.

Christian has just released his newest book, The Alignment Problem, which delves into the disparity that occurs when AI models don’t do exactly what they’re intended to do. 

The book follows on the success of Christian’s previous work, "The Most Human Human and Algorithms to Live By." Now a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley, Christian joined AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz to talk about the alignment problem and some new techniques being used to address the issue.

The alignment problem can be caused by a range of reasons — such as data bias, or datasets used incorrectly and out of context. As AI takes on a variety of tasks, from medical diagnostics to parole sentencing decisions, machine learning researchers are expressing concern over the problem.

Listen to the full podcast to hear about this and more — including Christian’s book club experience with Elon Musk and why he chose to double major in philosophy and computer science.</description>

        <title>On the Clock: High School Junior Ana DuCristea Creates Timely AI-based Reminder App - Ep. 133</title>
        <description>Canadian high schooler Ana DuCristea has a clever solution for the quarantine blues, as days blur into weeks. Using AI and natural language processing, she programmed an app capable of setting customizable reminders so you won’t miss any important activities, like baking banana bread or whipping up Dalgona coffee.

DuCristea, who’s familiar with Python and has taken a variety of online AI courses, set to work on the app after winning a Jetson Nano Developer Kit this summer at AI4ALL, an AI summer camp. She’d long been frustrated with the simplicity of current reminder apps and decided to create her own solution.

Using Python and the Nano, DuCristea developed an app in just two months that integrates with mobile and PC messaging program Discord. With the app, users can message a bot on Discord requesting a reminder for a specific task, date and time.</description>

        <title>Hey, Mr. DJ: Super Hi-Fi’s AI Applies Smarts to Sound - Ep. 132</title>
        <description>Brendon Cassidy, CTO and chief scientist at Super Hi-Fi, uses AI to give everyone the experience of a radio station tailored to their unique tastes.

Super Hi-Fi, an AI startup and member of the NVIDIA Inception program, develops technology that produces smooth transitions, intersperses content meaningfully and adjusts volume and crossfade. Started three years ago, Super Hi-Fi first partnered with iHeartRadio and is now also used by companies such as Peloton and Sonos.

Results are showing that users like this personalized approach. Cassidy notes that they tested MagicStitch, one of their tools that eliminates the gap between songs, and found that customers listening with MagicStitch turned on spent 10 percent more time streaming music.

        <title>AI4Good: Canadian Lab Empowers Women in Computer Science - Ep. 103</title>
        <description>Doina Precup is applying Romanian wisdom to the gender gap in the fields of AI and computer science.

The associate professor at McGill University and research team lead at AI startup DeepMind spoke with AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about her personal experiences, along with the AI4Good Lab she co-founded to give women more access to machine learning training.

Growing up in Romania, Precup attended a high school that specialized in computer science and a technical university. She didn’t experience gender disparity in these learning environments. 

“If anything, programming was considered a very good job for women, because you did not need to be working in the fields,” she explained.

It made the gap in Canadian universities and companies even more noticeable. At McGill, Precup saw that female students were hesitant to speak up or pursue graduate studies.

Together with Angelique Mannella, CEO of AM Consulting and an Amazon employee, Precup was inspired to start the AI4Good Lab in 2017.</description>

        <title>AI Startup Brings Computer Vision to Customer Service - Ep. 102</title>
        <description>When your appliances break, the last thing you want to do is spend an hour on the phone trying to reach a customer service representative. 

Using computer vision, Drishyam.AI is eliminating service lines to help consumers more quickly.

Satish Mandalika, the CEO and founder of the deep learning-based image recognition platform, spoke with AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about the company. 

“Customer support is ripe for disruption,” Mandalika said. Drishyam.AI is changing the game by giving customers an app that they use to take a picture of the product they need help with at any time of day or night, rather than calling a help line.

Using computer vision, Drishyam.AI analyzes the issue and communicates directly with manufacturers, rather than going through retail outlets. This is more efficient because a product’s lifetime warranty is usually held by the company that made it, rather than the stores selling it like Home Depot and Lowe’s.</description>

        <title>Focal Systems Brings AI to Grocery Stores - Ep. 97</title>
        <description>We’ve all chosen the self-checkout stand over the human cashier, thinking it’ll take less time.

But somehow, things take a terrible turn. The barcodes aren’t scanning, there’s a pop-up scolding you for not placing the product in the bagging area (though you did, of course), and an employee is coming over to fix the chaos.

It would’ve taken less time to go to the cashier.

Focal Systems is applying deep learning and computer vision to automate portions of retail stores in order to streamline store operations and get customers in and out more efficiently, without the pitfalls of the traditional self-checkout.

CEO Francois Chaubard sat down with AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz to talk about how the company is changing retailers.</description>

        <description>Imagine staring into the high-beams of an oncoming car. Now imagine trying to pick out a speck of dust in the glare of the headlights. That’s the challenge Olivier Guyon and Damien Gratadour face as they try to find the dull glint of an exoplanet — a planet orbiting a star outside our solar system — beside the bright light of its star.

The pair -- Guyon is an instrument developer for Japan’s Subaru Telescope, and an astronomer at the University of Arizona; and Gratadour is an associate professor at the Observatoire de Paris and an instrument scientist at the Australian National University -- spoke with AI Podcast host Noah Kravitz about how they’re using GPU-powered extreme adaptive optics in very large telescopes to image nearby habitable planets.</description>

        <description>Robots following coded instructions to complete a task? Old school. Robots learning to do things by watching how humans do it? That’s the future. Earlier this year, Stanford’s Animesh Garg and Marynel Vázquez shared their research in a talk on “Generalizable Autonomy for Robotic Mobility and Manipulation” at the GPU Technology Conference last week.  We caught up with them to learn more about generalizable autonomy - the idea that a robot should be able to observe human behavior, and learn to imitate it in a way that’s applicable to a variety of tasks and situations. Like learning to cook by watching YouTube videos, or figuring out how to cross a crowded room for another.</description>

        <title>Startup Uses AI to Give Consumers the Credit They Deserve - Ep. 64</title>
        <description>Credit scores are a funny thing. Funny might not be the right word, but you know what we mean. You can't have a credit score unless you have a credit history. You have to use your credit to keep your score up, but if your score's not good enough, you can't get credit. But never fear, AI and machine learning are here to help. Our guest on this episode is Ajay Gopal, he's with Deserve, a startup that's using machine learning to extend credit to people who may not have a typical credit history.</description>

        <title>Ep. 51: Live at GTC - Deep Learning Can Save Lives by Predicting Severe Weather</title>
        <description>One of the things that makes the weather so dangerous is that it's so hard to predict. Tornadoes, hail, high winds and flash floods cause billions of dollars worth of property damage, and injure or kill hundreds of people in the United States each year. Knowing when storms may strike can save lives, and property. Our guest is part of a team at the National Center for Atmospheric Research that's doing just that. We spoke with David John Gagne, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Center for Atmospheric Research about his work with deep learning at the GPU Technology Conference in Silicon Valley this week.</description>

        <description>Sarcasm? On the Internet? You're kidding. But sarcasm is no joke. Long before today's sentiment analysis systems struggled to accurately understand human communication, people struggled to understand one another's sarcasm. Now, thanks to the work of Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya and his team computers are beginning to understand one of humanity's most challenging, and amusing, modes of communication. Dr. Bhattacharyya, director of IIT Patna, and a professor at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at IIT Bombay has spent the past few years using GPU-powered deep learning to detect sarcasm.</description>

        <title>Ep. 44: Forget Polls, Here's What Street View, and AI, Can Tell You About How People Will Vote</title>
        <description>Election polling is an inexact science. If you've been paying attention to American politics at all over the past year or two, you don't need us to tell you that. But what if instead of asking voters their opinions on the candidates or the issues you took a different approach, one that involves artificial intelligence... and cars. Joining us for this edition of the AI podcast is Timnit Gebru, a post-doctoral researcher at Microsoft Research in New York and a newly minted PhD from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Timnit is co-author of a paper titled "Using Deep learning and Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of Neighborhoods Across the United States."</description>

        <description>Whether you're wandering through the sprawling virtual worlds of Grand Theft Auto... or just trying out a new couch in Ikea's virtual living room, virtual worlds are everywhere. But there's as problem. There just aren't enough artists to build all these virtual worlds and populate them with foes... or furniture. We spoke with Artomatix co-founder Eric Risser about how deep learning can help artists fill such burgeoning virtual worlds.</description>

        <title>Ep. 37: Sergey Levine on How Deep Learning Will Unleash a Robotics Revolution</title>
        <description>The robots that have taken on tasks in the real world - which is to say the world where physics apply - are primarily programmed to do a specific job, such as welding a joint in a car or sweeping up cat hair. So what if robots could learn, and take it a step further - what if they could teach themselves, and pass on their knowledge to other robots? Where could that take machines, and the notion of machine intelligence? And how fast could we get there? Those are the questions our guest Sergey Levine,  an assistant professor at UC Berkeley's department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, is finding answers to.</description>

        <title>Ep. 34: Pierre Barreau Explains How Aiva Uses Deep Learning to Make Music</title>
        <description>AI systems have been trained to take photos and transform them into the style of great artists like Van Gogh, Picasso, or J.M.W. Turner. Take a photo, pick a style, and what emerges looks kind of like the lost work of an artistic master. Now, AI is heading in a different artistic direction: music. The soaring music featured on today's podcast, which made its debut at our GPU Technology Conference, was composed by an AI system developed by our guest, Pierre Barreau, head of Luxembourg-based startup Aiva Technologies.</description>

        <description>We’ve heard of robots working in warehouses, picking the right windshield or a box of wiring harnesses from shevles. But what about making sure those shelves are stocked with the right stuff, in the right place, at the right time? Marc Gyongosi thinks that flying robots – better known as drones – are right for the job. Marc is the CEO founder of IFM, or Intelligent Flying Machines, which is pretty much what IFM does.</description>

        <description>Over the last few years data intensive machine learning solutions have supplanted rule-based software systems at many technology-based companies. Think about Amazon, Netflix, and Uber. But the gaming world hasn't exactly followed suit, at least not as quickly. Most games are still a delicate mix of hard-wired behavior in the form of traditional code, and somewhat more responsive behavior in the form of large collections of rules. Our guest, Danny Lange, VP of AI and Machine Learning at Unity Technologies, is taking a different tack, using deep learning to help with game creation, that subtle combination of art, story, and software.</description>
