<title>Rode's latest Wireless GO microphone system boasts 40 hours of on-board storage</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>Rode just announced the latest iteration of its well-regarded Wireless GO microphone system. The third-gen kit brings plenty of new features to the table, especially when compared to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-go-ii-unveiled-150043322.html">
<ins>2021‚Äôs Wireless GO II</ins>
</a>.</p>
<p>The microphone allows for 32-bit float on-board recording and audio can be captured directly to the receiver. The system allows up to 40 hours of footage, stored internally, and includes a new technology called GainAssist.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents">
</span>
<p>This is a compression algorithm, of sorts, that will ‚Äúdynamically balance audio levels on-the-fly.‚Äù Rode says the system eliminates ‚Äúthe wild fluctuations typically found in a raw recording.‚Äù The company even says that there should be little-to-no editing required in post when using this system. If the algorithm makes a mistake, the microphone includes a secondary storage channel that records a dry copy of the audio.</p>

<p>Most users will use these microphones connected to a camera of some kind, so on-board storage won‚Äôt be needed. Rode says that the new Wireless GO system can operate up to 260 meters from the receiver, so long as it's in the line of sight. The company also says that it is compatible with all Rode Series IV devices, including the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/rodecaster-pro-ii-details-000035416.html">

<ins>Rodecaster Video</ins>
</a>. This is in addition to offering ‚Äúuniversal compatibility with cameras, smartphones and computers.‚Äù</p>
<p>There are locking lavalier connectors and an integrated LCD screen for keeping an eye on battery and audio signal levels. Finally, this system is available in a whole bunch of limited-edition colors, including red, orange, pink and purple, among others. The Wireless GO II was only available in black and white.</p>

<title>Grok‚Äôs new ‚ÄòAurora‚Äô image generator is back, and rolling out to everyone on X</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>Update, December 9, 2024, 5:45PM ET:</strong> X today formally announced its Aurora image generator. &quot;Grok&#39;s new capabilities are now available on the X platform in select countries and will roll out to all users within a week,&quot; <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-image-generation-release">the company said in a blog post</a>. The original story, previously headlined &quot;X adds, then quickly removes, Grok‚Äôs new ‚ÄòAurora‚Äô image generator,&quot; follows unedited below:</p>
<hr>
<p>On Saturday, a new image generator called Aurora became available for some Grok users, many of whom <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/AILeaksAndNews/status/1865363337921384623">shared the tool‚Äôs results</a> on X touting their photorealism. But as of Sunday afternoon, Aurora appears to be gone. While it briefly showed up as an option in Grok‚Äôs model selection menu as ‚ÄúGrok 2 + Aurora (beta),‚Äù it‚Äôs since been replaced with ‚ÄúGrok 2 + Flux (beta).‚Äù It looks like Aurora may have gone public before it was meant to. In a tweet replying to one user who shared images of Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck created with Aurora, <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1865497141818401202">Elon Musk</a> said, ‚ÄúThis is our internal image generation system.

<title>Google's Willow quantum chip breakthrough is hidden behind a questionable benchmark</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>Google <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/">debuted Willow</a>, its latest quantum chip, on Wednesday, and if you‚Äôve spent any time online since, you‚Äôve undoubtedly run into some breathless reporting about it. Willow ‚Äúcrushes classical computers on a cosmic timescale,‚Äù <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://gizmodo.com/googles-willow-quantum-chip-crushes-classical-computers-on-a-cosmic-timescale-2000535901">proclaims one headline</a>; Google ‚Äúunveils ‚Äòmind-boggling‚Äô quantum computer chip,‚Äù <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c791ng0zvl3o">reads another</a>.  It‚Äôs all anchored by a claim that Willow can complete a computation that would theoretically take a classical computer significantly more time than the 14 billion years the universe has existed. But, as you can probably guess, what the chip represents is not so simple.</p>
<p>First, with Willow, Google makes no claim of quantum supremacy, something the company <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-23-google-quantum-supremacy.html">did</a> when it publicly debuted its previous generation quantum computer, Sycamore, back in 2019. You may recall that, at the time, Google publicized how it took Sycamore just 200 seconds to perform a calculation that would have theoretically taken the world‚Äôs <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-08-summit-supercomputer-research-ai-oak-ridge.html">then-fastest supercomputer</a> 10,000 years to complete. That feat, the company said, demonstrated that it had created a quantum computer that could solve problems the best classical computers could not even attempt. In other words, Google had <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://research.google/blog/quantum-supremacy-using-a-programmable-superconducting-processor/">achieved quantum supremacy</a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents">
</span>
<div id="28d1e6fcd1974b458fa76e2bc64220a0">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7ppd_RY-UE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com">
</iframe>
</div>
<p>However, that claim quickly ended in controversy, with one researcher calling the company‚Äôs announcement ‚Äúindefensible‚Äù and ‚Äújust plain wrong,‚Äù and Google has since avoided talking about quantum supremacy. Instead, it just says it has achieved ‚Äúbeyond classical computation.‚Äù Part of the issue was that Sycamore was not a general-purpose quantum computer; instead, it was designed to surpass classical computers in a single task known as random circuit sampling or RCS. The thing about RCS is that, in Google‚Äôs own words, it has ‚Äúno known real-world applications.‚Äù Yet, here again, the company is touting RCS performance.</p>
<p>Google says Willow can complete its latest RCS benchmark in under five minutes. By contrast, the company estimates it would take <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-supercomputer-ai-amd-cray-department-of-energy-frontier.html">Frontier</a>, currently the world‚Äôs second most powerful supercomputer, 10 septillion years to complete the same task. That number, Google says, ‚Äúlends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse.‚Äù</p>

</figure>
<p>More practically, Google tries to make the case that RCS performance should be the metric by which all quantum computers are judged. According to Hartmut Neven, the founder of Google Quantum AI, ‚Äúit‚Äôs an entry point. If you can‚Äôt win on random circuit sampling, you can‚Äôt win on any other algorithm either.‚Äù He adds RCS is ‚Äúnow widely used as a standard in the field.‚Äú&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, other companies, including <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-volume-256">IBM</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-honeywell-quantum-computer.html">Honeywell</a>, instead use a metric called quantum volume to tout their breakthroughs. They claim it points to a more holistic understanding of a machine‚Äôs capabilities by factoring in how its qubits interact with one another. Unfortunately, you won‚Äôt find any mention of quantum volume in the spec sheet Google shared for Willow, making comparisons difficult.</p>
<div id="26f1f4b7ecfa4f5da3b0bccbe7996195">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_KrC1mzd0g?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" data-embed-domain="www.youtube.com">
</iframe>
</div>
<p>To that point, the far more impressive claim Google is making today is that Willow is ‚Äúbelow the threshold.‚Äù To date, the problem that has plagued every attempt to build a useful quantum computer is that the quantum bits they‚Äôre based on are difficult to control. They only hold their quantum state for fractions of a second, and the more qubits are added to a system, the more likely it is to produce errors. However, with Willow, Google says it has found a way to reduce errors as it adds more qubits to the system. According to the company, Willow is the first time this has been done.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the first system below threshold, this is the most convincing prototype for a scalable logical qubit built to date. It‚Äôs a strong sign that useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built,‚Äù says Neven. ‚ÄúWillow brings us closer to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that can‚Äôt be replicated on conventional computers.‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the real breakthrough here, and one that points to a future where quantum computers could solve problems that have tangible effects on people&#39;s lives. That future, however, isn&#39;t here just yet, and even Google admits it has more work to do before it gets there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/googles-willow-quantum-chip-breakthrough-is-hidden-behind-a-questionable-benchmark-224707174.html?src=rss]]>

<p>To check out Apple's new AI, you must have an eligible device and run the current iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 or MacOS 15.1. (On the iPhone side, that's basically the current iPhone 16 models plus last year's iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.) You'll also need to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115">join the waitlist</a> in the Settings app, but Apple Support says it usually only takes a few hours to gain access. Once approved, you'll receive a notification saying it's ready to activate on your device.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents">

Here's what Apple has said is coming.</p>
<p>
<strong>Genmoji:</strong> You'll be able to create custom emojis called Genmoji by using photos of friends and family or by typing a description of what you want.</p>
<p>
<strong>Image Playground:</strong> This tool will let you quickly create fun images, like turning yourself into a cartoon character, and let you come up with a new image based on the description you give.</p>
<p>
<strong>ChatGPT integration:</strong> Perhaps the most well-known AI tool will be built-in to Writing Tools and Siri to help out with requests. For instance, if you ask Siri about a certain document, ChatGPT can help. But Apple is, as usual, prioritizing privacy considerations: You'll always be asked before your information is shared and you'll control when it's used.</p>
<p>
<strong>Priority Notifications:</strong> When you receive multiple notifications each day, they'll be prioritized by what‚Äôs most important. For instance, if you have a dinner reservation that evening or an important meeting to attend, those notifications will be shown at the top of your notifications so you don't forget.</p>
<p>
<strong>Visual intelligence (iPhone 16 series only):</strong> Using the new <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-hands-on-how-does-a-faux-camera-control-button-feel-so-real-191406863.html">Camera Control button</a> on the <a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus-review-closing-the-gap-to-the-pro-120050824.html">iPhone 16</a> lineup, you'll be able to learn about and interact with objects and places right in front of you. For instance, you can use it to translate a sign from one language to another or find out more about a restaurant you've never been to by opening the Camera app, then pressing and holding the Camera Control button.</p>
<p>
<em>In 2025</em>, we'll see a more robust Siri integration. For starters, it's getting onscreen awareness to "take action with things on your screen." So if a friend texts you their new email address or when their birthday is, you can ask Siri to add it to their contact card.</p>

For instance, you can remove strangers from your family photo at the beach or that piece of laundry you forgot to put away. And if you have thousands of photos and videos saved, you can now find what you're looking for by describing it ‚Äî show all photos featuring a blue house with a red door, for example.</p>
<p>
<strong>Writing Tools:</strong> You can use this in most apps to help proofread your text, as well as craft different versions of what you've written until you find the right words. For example, if you need to write a cover letter or send an email to your boss, you can use Writing Tools to help you communicate what you need to say. This tool will also summarize an entire lecture for you, or any text you select. More features will be added in future updates.</p>
<p>
<strong>Summarized notifications:</strong> If you receive dozens of notifications each day, you'll now see a summary of the messages to make it easier to read through them.</p>
<p>
<strong>Siri improvements:</strong> Apple has given Siri an AI makeover to make conversations with the smart assistant more natural, but more. And for your convenience, you'll be able to switch back and forth between giving commands by voice or by typing to Siri. The bot also comes with "richer language-understanding capabilities," which is helpful if you tend to jump from thought to thought while talking.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Siri improvements:</strong> Apple is pledging to make Siri more dynamic and useful with a series of upgrades coming in 2025. In the meantime, you can now switch back and forth between giving commands by voice or by typing. The assistant is also now said to offer "richer language-understanding capabilities," which is helpful if you tend to jump from thought to thought while talking. And it now features a new interface, which shows a glowing edge on your screen when activated.&nbsp;</p>

<title>TikTok asks court to delay the law that would ban its app next month</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>TikTok is beginning its last-ditch legal challenge to avoid a ban in the United States. The company filed an <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-files-emergency-motion-for-injunction" data-original-link="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-files-emergency-motion-for-injunction">
<ins>emergency injunction</ins>
</a> in federal court Monday, asking for a delay in the law that would ban the app from taking effect so it could have time to mount a Supreme Court challenge.</p>
<p>The new court filing comes just three days after the company <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-inches-closer-to-a-us-ban-after-judges-shoot-down-appeal-172748902.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-inches-closer-to-a-us-ban-after-judges-shoot-down-appeal-172748902.html">

</a> its initial court challenge to the law, currently set to take effect January 19, 2025, that requires app stores and internet providers to block TikTok if ByteDance doesn‚Äôt sell the app. In their <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000193-9cbc-df60-a797-ffbfe6400000" data-original-link="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000193-9cbc-df60-a797-ffbfe6400000">

<span id="end-legacy-contents">
</span>
<p>TikTok has argued the law is unconstitutional and that it would unjustly hurt creators and businesses that rely on its service. ‚ÄúEstimates show that small businesses on TikTok would lose more than $1 billion in revenue and creators would suffer almost $300 million in lost earnings in just one month unless the TikTok Ban is halted,‚Äù TikTok said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>In its latest filing, TikTok notes that President-elect Donald Trump has promised to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the app and that temporarily halting the law would allow ‚Äúthe incoming Administration to evaluate this matter.‚Äù Right now, the law is slated to take effect the day before Trump‚Äôs inauguration.</p>
<p>The company requested a decision by December 16. Even if the injunction isn‚Äôt granted, it‚Äôs still not quite the end of the line for the company‚Äôs legal challenges. If the Supreme Court ends up taking on the case, TikTok would have another opportunity to try to get the law overturned.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-asks-court-to-delay-the-law-that-would-ban-its-app-next-month-192427139.html?src=rss]]>

<title>OpenAI's Sora video generation AI model arrives globally later today</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>Following <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-sora-model-can-generate-minute-long-videos-from-text-prompts-195717694.html">an early preview at the start of the year</a>, Sora, OpenAI&#39;s long-awaited video generation model, is ready for public use. If you&#39;re a ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscriber in the US or &quot;most other countries&quot; where the chatbot is available, you can begin experimenting with the tool starting later today, OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/">announced on Monday</a>. A more powerful model powers the product than the one OpenAI showed off in February. Sora Turbo is significantly faster, according to the company, though OpenAI cautions the new model still has limitations. &quot;It often generates unrealistic physics and struggles with complex actions over long durations,&quot; says the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When users first visit the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://sora.com/">dedicated landing page</a> OpenAI has set up for Sora, they&#39;ll be greeted with a feed of videos the model has created for other people. By clicking on a video, you&#39;ll be able to see the exact prompt someone gave Sora to generate the footage you see. From here, you can also decide to re-cut a video, blend it into a clip you&#39;re working on, or remix it. In this initial release, OpenAI is limiting Sora to generating videos that are up to 1080p and 20 seconds long.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents">

</iframe>
</div>
<p>ChatGPT Plus subscribers can use Sora to create up to 50 videos at 480p per month. Alternatively, Plus users can generate fewer (and shorter) videos at 720p. OpenAI says the Pro plan affords 10 times as much usage, at higher resolutions and longer durations. &quot;We‚Äôre working on tailored pricing for different types of users, which we plan to make available early next year,&quot; the company adds.</p>
<p>For safety purposes, each video features a visible watermark by default and contains C2PA metadata to assist with identification. OpenAI says it will block users from using Sora to create child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) and sexual deepfakes. More broadly, the company plans to limit uploads of people until it has time to refine its safeguards against deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you don&#39;t have a ChatGPT subscription, you can still visit the Sora website to see what other people are using the tool to create. During today&#39;s livestream, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it may take some time before Sora arrives in Europe and the UK.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openais-sora-video-generation-ai-model-arrives-globally-later-today-182613208.html?src=rss]]>

<title>One of our favorite robot vacuums is on sale for only $129</title>

<![CDATA[<p>When it comes to robot vacuum cleaners, there's one brand that probably springs to mind before any other. But there are plenty of great options out there beyond Roomba, and one of our favorite models is on sale for nearly half off. The Anker Eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 11S Max has <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=eaeac9a8-0ddf-4ccb-a6dc-61a107bb43fa&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAUDPGDJz9c9aI-v3y9r9q9slWgcdRXiYPMxMnIZ3E53-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Super-Thin-Super-Strong-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile%2Fdp%2FB07R295MLS" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Super-Thin-Super-Strong-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile/dp/B07R295MLS?th=1">dropped to $129</a>, which is a discount of 48 percent or $120.</p>

</p>
<p>We appreciate the slim profile that makes it easy for the RoboVac 11S to clean under low furniture. We found the vacuum to have a long battery life and good suction power, especially for its size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main drawback is the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity. That means you won't be able to bark a request for a spot clean at your voice assistant. Instead, you'll need to use a remote to control the vacuum, but it still has many of the features you'd expect from an app-operated model, such as scheduled cleanings. You can also start a cleaning by pressing a button on the top of the unit.</p>
<p>The RoboVac 11S starts cleaning in auto mode with the aim of optimizing the process as it saunters around your home. However, you can select spot cleans and edge cleaning using the remote. One other welcome feature, especially for a robot vacuum in this price range, is the inclusion of effective object detection. So if you're on the hunt for a wallet-friendly robot vacuum for yourself or a loved one, the RoboVac 11S is definitely worth considering ‚Äî especially at this price.</p>

<title>Bose Smart Soundbar review: Using earbuds as surround sound speakers</title>

Sonos has consistently been our top pick for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html">best midrange soundbar</a> for years.

<p>Bose may be best known for its noise-canceling headphones and earbuds, but the company has a solid track record with speakers and soundbars too. These devices typically exhibit the same fondness for clear, warm sound, which means that finer details are never a problem. Bose also likes to throw in handy features to expand a speaker‚Äôs utility, with things like dialog boost, room tuning and more. For the Smart Soundbar though, the company allows you to use a set of its wireless earbuds as rear surround speakers, taking a slightly different approach than Sonos on bringing headphones to the living room.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-whats-good-about-the-bose-smart-soundbar">What‚Äôs good about the Bose Smart Soundbar?</h2>
<p>Bose succeeded in building a compact soundbar with a simple design that won‚Äôt be much of a distraction on your mantle or TV stand. Five drivers provide ample clarity, so even finer details and sound effects come through clearly, and the speaker arrangement offers pleasant directional audio from the soundbar alone. This is partially due to the fact that Bose employs two upfiring drivers in the center of the speaker. For the times you don‚Äôt have access to Dolby Atmos content, Bose‚Äôs TrueSpace tech will upmix the sound for a spatial experience.</p>
<p>The company provides an AI-powered Dialog Mode that re-balances voices against all of the other sounds so that spoken words can be heard clearly at all times. It does so without sacrificing the immersive aspects of the soundstage, so it‚Äôs not just a volume boost on the talking. I found Bose‚Äôs take on dialog to be among the best I‚Äôve tested, right up there with Sonos, so I left it active during almost all of my testing, which isn‚Äôt the case for most soundbars I‚Äôve reviewed.</p>
<p>The main appeal of the Smart Soundbar will be how Bose chose to integrate a set of its earbuds with the speaker. A feature called Personal Surround Sound puts rear channels inside the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review-function-meets-fashion-140015467.html">Ultra Open Earbuds</a>, leaving the main audio coming from the soundbar. Since these earbuds have an open-ear design, you can clearly hear everything, leaving your brain to mash them together in your head. I think Bose wanted to offer something akin to <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html">Sonos‚Äô TV Audio Swap</a> without directly copying it, and Personal Surround Sound allows users to add rear speakers with an investment that doesn‚Äôt just sit on a shelf when it's not in use.</p>

<p>Personal Surround works well, and the best part about it is it‚Äôs adjustable. There are options for volume, center channel and ‚Äúheight &amp; surround‚Äù levels so you can increase or decrease the amplification of each sound source. These three parameters give you the ability to pipe in more than just the would-be rear channels into the earbuds. You can get some dialog via the center channel control, as well as increase the overall volume if the stock effect is too subdued.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs more, you can disable Personal Surround altogether and the Ultra Open Earbuds will play the full audio that‚Äôs coming through the Smart Soundbar. Also, lowering the volume on the speaker completely turns the Bose earbuds into something closer to Sonos‚Äô TV Audio Swap, which is great for movies and shows when others are sleeping or don‚Äôt want to be disturbed. This mode is what Bose calls SimpleSync, and it‚Äôs compatible with the company‚Äôs recent Bluetooth speakers as well as the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds and QuietComfort 45 headphones.</p>
<p>Another handy feature is the ability to adjust the center and height channels on the Smart Soundbar itself. Bose also gives you the option to raise or lower the bass and treble, as well as a Wall EQ toggle that adjusts the tone if you‚Äôve mounted the speaker under your TV. This is all nice to have, but I used the center channel adjustment the most as cranking it up increased the effect of directional audio coming from the soundbar. There‚Äôs a good amount out of the box, but this tweak takes it up a notch, providing some pleasant sound reflections off of nearby walls. It‚Äôs great for movies and shows with lots of zooming vehicles and noise, like race clips in <em>Drive to Survive </em>or battle scenes in <em>Rogue One</em>.</p>

<p>Like most soundbars, the Smart Soundbar doesn‚Äôt produce enough low-end thump on its own to provide a <em>fully</em> immersive audio experience. Despite the crisp detail and good directional movement, the speaker would benefit from Bose‚Äôs wireless subwoofer (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Bose;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=da41807c-aae5-49ff-b905-2c3f70122c64&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b285c4c9-fa07-49cd-b098-97eaa3081700&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bose&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3NlLmNvbS9jL2hvbWUtdGhlYXRlci9iYXNzLW1vZHVsZXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyODVjNGM5LWZhMDctNDljZC1iMDk4LTk3ZWFhMzA4MTcwMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zZS5jb20vYy9ob21lLXRoZWF0ZXIvYmFzcy1tb2R1bGVzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAa8uNIqu4D31986CExozbQ4hFEcuzfB1Ek0NF1XDC-Kd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fc%2Fhome-theater%2Fbass-modules" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bose.com/c/home-theater/bass-modules">starting at $499</a>) for a 5.1 setup. The company also offers two options for rear speakers <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Bose;elmt:;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=da41807c-aae5-49ff-b905-2c3f70122c64&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b285c4c9-fa07-49cd-b098-97eaa3081700&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bose&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3NlLmNvbS9jL2hvbWUtdGhlYXRlci9zdXJyb3VuZC1zcGVha2VycyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjI4NWM0YzktZmEwNy00OWNkLWIwOTgtOTdlYWEzMDgxNzAwIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3NlLmNvbS9jL2hvbWUtdGhlYXRlci9zdXJyb3VuZC1zcGVha2VycyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAce6ObLS2P0XTRN2Wh5IPPbp_MS0n6XrDqJNghmNEsSv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fc%2Fhome-theater%2Fsurround-speakers" class="rapid-with-clickid" data-original-link="https://www.bose.com/c/home-theater/surround-speakers">starting at $399</a>, which would allow everyone in the room to enjoy the added surround channels. Is the Smart Soundbar good enough on its own for smaller spaces? Probably for TV and movies, but if you‚Äôre tapping it to pull double duty as a music speaker, you‚Äôll want to add a sub.</p>
<p>Bose‚Äôs Personal Surround Sound feature is a nice perk, but only one person can use it at a time, so it‚Äôs really for solo watching at this point. Unless, of course, you want to be a jerk and give yourself the expanded sound and leave your partner, family or friends with the stock experience.</p>
<p>Functionally, the Smart Soundbar responded to my commands and all of its modes worked well. One thing that did annoy me was its reluctance to automatically find the correct input when I turned the TV on after listening to music over AirPlay. Every other soundbar I‚Äôve tested will begin playing TV audio when the screen flickers on, although some may take a few seconds longer than others to kick in. With this soundbar, I sometimes had to select the audio source in the app for things to work properly.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not one to harp on soundbar remotes, but I‚Äôm compelled to do so here. The accessory Bose includes with the Smart Soundbar feels very cheap. It‚Äôs similar to what might come with a fan or lamp, although this one has a more robust plastic frame so it‚Äôs slightly sturdier. I understand the desire to include a remote control with a $500 soundbar, but it either needed a little more polish or Bose could‚Äôve just left all of the controls to the app.</p>

There are a lot of similarities between the Beam and Smart Soundbar, and a few small but notable differences. Sonos‚Äô advantage lies in its TV Audio Swap tool and larger ecosystem, though that edge is hampered by <a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/why-is-the-sonos-app-so-broken-140028060.html">the ongoing app rebuild</a>. Sonos also provides dynamic head tracking for even more immersion, which Bose‚Äôs soundbar lacks. Bose offers multiroom audio with the Smart Soundbar and you can use the Ultra Open Earbuds for personal listening of TV sound on top of the surround feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It‚Äôs clear that Bose is taking aim at Sonos with the Smart Soundbar, so the question then becomes which company‚Äôs audio tuning do you prefer. Since they both offer things like Atmos audio, room calibration, dialog enhancement and headphone use, the choice comes down to personal sonic sensibilities. I think Bose does enough with its earbud integration to make this a tough decision, so long as you're willing to spend the $300 to get the additional device.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/bose-smart-soundbar-review-using-earbuds-as-surround-sound-speakers-153028639.html?src=rss]]>

<title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review ‚Äì whip-smart, fascist-fighting, open-world adventuring</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>The archeologist heads to Vatican City and the Egyptian Pyramids in this unconventional blockbuster, for lots of cleverly designed stealth, combat and puzzle-solving fun</p>
<p>Making an Indiana Jones game today seems like a straightforward endeavour: you take <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/07/nathan-drake-uncharted-4-naughty-dog">Uncharted‚Äôs Nathan Drake</a>, send him back in time 80-odd years, give him a fedora and a bullwhip and sit back and watch the golden idols roll in. The Uncharted developer Naughty Dog perfected the template for Indy-inspired globetrotting action games more than a decade ago, and nobody would blame Swedish studio MachineGames if it stuck to it.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle opts not to. Instead, it often goes out of its way to frustrate such comparisons. This unconventional blockbuster has more in common with games such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/oct/08/dishonored-review">Dishonored</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jan/22/hitman-3-review-a-wild-bacchanalian-backdrop-to-bloody-escapades">Hitman</a> than it does with Uncharted. Sure, it has action and spectacle and occasionally dabbles in platforming, but it places far greater emphasis on puzzles, open-ended stealth, and letting you beat the snot out of fascists while dressed as a priest.</p>

<title>The Raspberry Pi 500 is a $90 computer in a keyboard</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>Raspberry Pi has just released its new computer-in-a-keyboard, the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-500/">
<ins>Raspberry Pi 500</ins>
</a>,  the successor to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-400-diy-maker-computer-080002292.html">
<ins>Raspberry Pi 400</ins>
</a>. It shares most of the same internal components as the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-raspberry-pi-5-uses-the-companys-own-chip-designs-061316561.html">
<ins>Raspberry Pi 5</ins>
</a>, but with a keyboard shell and improved heatsink ‚Äî all for $90.</p>
<p>The Pi 500 is equipped with a 2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 CPU and comes with 8GB of RAM. It has three USB A ports (two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port) but no USB-C slots besides the charger, which doesn‚Äôt support peripherals like mice and docks. Both WiFi and Ethernet are supported natively, along with Bluetooth 5.0. The package also includes a 32GB microSD card preloaded with Raspberry Pi OS, a Linux distribution based on Debian.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents">
</span>
<p>Currently, the Pi 500 only has US and UK keyboards, but variants in other languages like Spanish and Japanese are on the way, <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/its-a-raspberry-pi-5-in-a-keyboard-and-its-called-the-raspberry-pi-500/">
<em>
<ins>TechCrunch</ins>
</em>
</a> notes. Depending on the language, the keyboard can have 78 to 83 keys.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 500, by itself or as a desktop kit, is now available through approved resellers. The $120 desktop kit contains the Pi 500 computer, a mouse, a USB-C power supply, an HDMI cable and a beginner‚Äôs guide. Monitors aren‚Äôt included in the package, though today Raspberry Pi also introduced its new <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-monitor/">

<title>Reddit introduces AI-powered 'Reddit Answers' search feature</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year Reddit <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/search-engines-that-dont-pay-up-cant-index-reddit-content-172949170.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/search-engines-that-dont-pay-up-cant-index-reddit-content-172949170.html">
<ins>cracked down</ins>
</a> on AI companies and some major search engines, saying that companies would not be allowed to scrape its site unless they struck licensing deals with the company. Now, the ‚Äúfront page of the internet‚Äù is introducing its own AI-powered search feature.</p>
<p>Called ‚ÄúReddit Answers,‚Äù the feature provides summaries of conversations and posts from across the site in a ‚Äúconversational interface.‚Äù Relying on content from all public, SFW subreddits, the goal is for Reddit to be able to directly provide relevant results for queries that people may otherwise find via Google searches, where it‚Äôs become increasingly common to append ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù to queries.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents">
</span>
<p>While that sounds a lot like a Reddit-based search engine, VP of product Serkan Piantino says that Reddit Answers isn‚Äôt necessarily trying to come up with a singular answer the way you might expect with a Google search. Instead, the tools surfaced a handful of bullet points pulled directly from relevant threads on Reddit. Those conversations are linked directly in the interface, as are relevant subreddits where users can dive deeper into similar topics. ‚ÄúA big theme is that it does sort of guide you towards the content itself, instead of trying to represent an answer on its own,‚Äù Piantino tells Engadget.</p>

<div class="photo-credit">Reddit</div>
</figure>
<p>Reddit gave me early access to the feature and the current version looks a bit like Meta‚Äôs AI search suggestions in Instagram, with a few dozen suggested queries and accompanying emoji. The responses, however, are detailed and link directly to highly-upvoted comments from various subreddits where Redditors have previously weighed in on similar topics. That‚Äôs helpful because some of the results may not make sense without the broader context from the thread (like in the answer screenshotted adobe that references an image of Price Harry).</p>
<p>I also noticed that many of Reddit‚Äôs built-in suggestions centered around product questions, like ‚Äúbest robot vacuum‚Äù or ‚Äúbest vitamin C serum.‚Äù While that‚Äôs not necessarily surprising ‚Äî many people already turn to Reddit forums for buying advice ‚Äî it also raises questions about whether the company could potentially monetize the new search feature. ‚ÄúIt's something that we've thought about at a high level, but we have no immediate plans for monetization,‚Äù Piantino said when I asked him about it.</p>
<p>For now, he said, the feature is still in beta and will be rolling out slowly. As of today, Reddit Answers is making its way to a ‚Äúlimited number‚Äù of users in the US on web and iOS, with a broader rollout expected sometime next year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-introduces-ai-powered-reddit-answers-search-feature-140028655.html?src=rss]]>

<title>The Morning After: X adds, then quickly removes, Grok‚Äôs new photorealistic image generator</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[<p>A new image generator called Aurora briefly opened for testing for some Grok users, and the tool‚Äôs results shared on X appeared far more realistic than X‚Äôs previous image generators. It was a brief debut, though. By Sunday afternoon, Aurora was gone. For a short time, there was a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-adds-then-quickly-removes-groks-new-aurora-image-generator-181917002.html">Grok 2 + Aurora</a> (beta) option in Grok‚Äôs model selection menu, which is now replaced by Grok 2 + Flux (beta). It looks like Aurora may have gone public before it was meant to.</p>
<p>Grok‚Äôs previous image generator was called out for lacking certain restrictions on the content it can produce, like offensive images of politicians and celebrities. <em>TechCrunch </em>was able to generate an image of ‚Äúa bloodied [Donald] Trump‚Äù ‚Äî the kind of thing AI image generators are restricted from creating. In that brief period, paying Grok users leaped at the chance to put Adam Sandler and Ray Romano in photos together, or <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/EnsoMatt/status/1865423123950064125">Captain Picard in a Christmas hat.</a> Sure.

<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said it has ordered federal supervision of Google Payment Corp. after determining that it meets the legal requirements for such oversight. The CFPB monitors banks, credit unions and other financial institutions and recently finalized a rule to supervise digital payment apps. The CFPB said it has ‚Äúreasonable cause to determine that Google has engaged in conduct that poses risks to consumers.‚Äù Google filed a lawsuit shortly after the announcement to challenge the decision. The risks identified by the CFPB are tied to Google‚Äôs handling of erroneous transactions and fraud prevention.</p>
